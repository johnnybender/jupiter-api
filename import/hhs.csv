DDOD use case to request access to Medicare Part D Drug Event File (PDE) for cost transparency to pharmacies and patients.

WHAT IS A USE CASE?

A “Use Case” is a request that was made by the user community because there were no available datasets that met their particular needs.  If this use case is similar to your needs, we ask that you add your own requirements to the specifications section.

The concept of a use case falls within the http://hhs.ddod.us Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) program and gives you a formalized way to identify what data you need.  It’s for anyone in industry, research, media, nonprofits or other government agencies.  Each request becomes a DDOD use case, so that it can be prioritized and worked on.

Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.

PURPOSE

The PDE data contain prescription drug costs and payment data that enable CMS to make payments to the plans and otherwise administer the Part D benefit. When a beneficiary fills a prescription under Medicare Part D, a prescription drug plan sponsor must submit a record to CMS. The PDE data are not the same as individual drug claim transactions but are extracts using CMS-defined standard fields.  The challenge is that this data is not available publicly, even with all PHI fields stripped out.  It resides in ResDAC/CCW, but has 1 year lag time and 3-4 months processing time.

VALUE

Central to operations for drug cost comparisons for use by pharmacists and consumers. Multiple companies are looking how to better manage costs.

Use Cases also provide a wealth of insights about existing alternative datasets and tips for interpreting and manipulating data for specific purposes.

PURPOSE

This use case was requested with the goal of obtaining a ""single source of truth"" for medical device recalls, rather than trying to reconcile between the two data sources.  It needs to:

Provide unique recall ID to link data from these two sources.
  Provide standardized, consistent product name or registered device key (such as PMA # or 510(k) #)
VALUE

The value of the use case is to helps hospitals more effectively catch devices in their inventory that have been recalled and prevent them from buying potentially unsafe ones.  It improves outcomes and patient safety by lowering probability of hospitals being unaware of devices have been recalled.

PURPOSE

PCORnet funded outcomes research often relies on NDI for mortality events not captured within the medical system
Example: ""Aspirin trial"": Optimal maintenance dose of aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD)
Example: Comparative Effectiveness of Liver Transplant Strategies for End-Stage Liver Disease Patients on Renal Replacement Therapy

VALUE

Complete data is a requirement in order to conduct research.  In addition, mortality events outside of healthcare setting don't always get captured.  This data would be useful in many comparative effectiveness research studies, regardless of whether funded by PCORI.

PURPOSE

Value-Based Payment Modifier (VBM) reporting provides the quality composite and cost composite scores for each provider groups and performance year.  But currently, these scores are only available within each group's private QRUR report. This use case requests that data for all providers be made readily available, so that providers have the ability to benchmark and compare across their peer groups.

VALUE

Greater transparency to provider quality and cost rankings helps consumers make smarter choices.  Earlier and broader visibility into metrics, might have a ""peer pressure"" effect on providers to improve quality.  It may also deliver insights for providers and assist them in Meaningful Use attestation.

PURPOSE

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has multiple data sources for registered medical devices, including http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htmMedical Device Reporting (MDR), http://www.fda.gov/Medicaldevices/Deviceregulationandguidance/Howtomarketyourdevice/Premarketsubmissions/Premarketapprovalpma/Default.HtmPremarket Approval (PMA), http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/510kClearances/510(k), and https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfrl/rl.cfmEstablishment Registration and Device Listing (R&amp;L).  There are a number of challenges associated with the data, including:

A single marketed product often has multiple 510(k)s
  A PMA might represent multiple marketed products over the course of the evolution of the device
  510(k) and PMA downloads only include class II and III devices, omitting class I
The only current way to consolidate the information across these various databases in a reliable manner is via FOIA request.  There have already been multiple requests for this data at regular refresh intervals.

VALUE

A single source for all registered medical devices is needed for core services on medical device insights provided to hospitals.  In addition, without a single source of data, it is difficult for hospitals to understand the available substitutes for a given device.

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.

The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).

Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.

The NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.

The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.

The TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states. Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.

TEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.

Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.

The data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).

N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a ""snapshot"" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.

The N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.

DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.

The dataset does not include plan selections from the District of Columbia and 13 other states that have State-based Marketplaces.

Data for ZIP Codes with 50 or fewer plan selections are not included to protect individuals privacy. A total of 13,725 ZIP Codes with at least 51 plan selections per ZIP Code are included in the table. These data account for 97 percent of the total 7.16 million overall plan selections in the 37 states as of January 16, 2015.

The sum of plan selections among ZIP Codes within a state using this dataset may not be equal to state-level totals provided in the state level snapshots. This is because ZIP Code-level data does not appear for ZIP Codes with 50 or fewer plan selections, and as a result the dataset does not include all plan selections within a state.

Data from the AQS is considered the ""gold standard"" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data.

As growing numbers of Medicaid enrollees receive comprehensive health benefits through managed care, the researchers and policy makers seeking to understand the service use of these enrollees must rely on encounter data information that states receive from managed care plans. Although encounter data provide insight, not all states report it to CMS Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), and little is known about the datas usability. This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers. Most states that have comprehensive managed care plans reported data to the other services (OT), inpatient (IP), and prescription drug (RX) files in 2008. Of those data, the majority are usable.

The core set includes a range of childrens quality measures encompassing both physical and mental health. The 2015 Child Core Set was released through a December 2014 Informational Bulletin. The CHIPRA legislation provides that the Secretary shall issue updates to the Child Core Set beginning in January 2013 and annually thereafter. CMS worked with the National Quality Forums (NQF) Measures Application Partnership (MAP) to review the Child Core Set and to identify ways to improve it. A background report contains information on the MAPs review process, selection criteria, and feedback to CMS. State data derived from the core measures are part of the Secretarys Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP. States can voluntarily report the Child Core Set measures by using the 2015 Technical Specifications and Resource Manual. A summary of updates to the child core set technical specifications and resource manual for FFY 2015 is also available. CMS also has other initiatives that relate to childrens quality measures, including a Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) and the Pediatric Electronic Health Record Format. Section 401(a) of CHIPRA requires the Secretary of HHS to summarize state-specific information on the quality of health care furnished to children under Medicaid and CHIP. The first report was published in 2010 and annually thereafter.

The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March/April 2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially during an economic downturn.

The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services. The Competitive Acquisition Omburdsmans (CAOs) role is to help ensure that inquiries and complaints about the Program are resolved. As an ombudsman, the CAO also works with other areas of CMS to identify potential systemic issues with the goal of helping CMS ensure that beneficiaries have access to and suppliers provide high-quality DMEPOS items and services. The CAO also provides an annual report to Congress. In order to protect the interests of potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has been conducting real-time claims analysis to monitor health status for groups of Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Health status results are shown in the files on this site. Each file includes a written summary of results and graphical displays of key indicators reflective of the health status of beneficiaries and their access to DMEPOS items and services. The data is derived from claims for Medicare populations in each CBA and a corresponding comparator region that is similar to the CBA.

The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients perspectives on hospital care. The HCAHPS survey is also known as the CAHPS Hospital Survey or Hospital CAHPS. HCAHPS is a core set of questions that can be combined with a broader, customized set of hospital-specific items. HCAHPS survey items complement the data hospitals currently collect to support improvements in internal customer services and quality related activities. The HCAHPS survey contains 21 patient perspectives on care and patient rating items that encompass nine key topics- communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, and transition of care. The survey also includes four screener questions and seven demographic items, which are used for adjusting the mix of patients across hospitals and for analytical purposes. The survey is 32 questions in length. HCAHPS On-Line, the official HCAHPS Web site, houses a series of tables that summarize current and historic HCAHPS results. These HCAHPS Tables, available exclusively on HCAHPS On-Line, are based on the HCAHPS data participating hospitals submit to CMS.

Researchers and policymakers can use the KID to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. Restricted access data files are available with a data use agreement and brief online security training.

The KID is the only hospital administrative dataset designed specifically to assess use of hospital services by newborns, children, and adolescents. The KID enables studies of specific conditions, procedures, and subpopulations that often cannot be assessed with other databases because children account for a relatively small proportion of hospital stays.

Using the KID, it is possible to study varied topics including the incidence of uncommon conditions such as congenital anomalies, the economic burden associated with specific procedures or conditions such as adolescent pregnancy, and the pediatric conditions most often associated with particular outcomes such as death in the hospital.

The KID is the only all-payer inpatient care database for children in the United States.  It is a sample of pediatric discharges from 2,500-4,000 U.S. hospitals yielding approximately two to three million unweighted hospital discharges for children per year.  About 10 percent of normal newborns and 80 percent of other neonatal and pediatric stays are selected from each hospital that is sampled.

The KID contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  It includes charge information on all patients, regardless of payer, including children covered by Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured. It is created every three years beginning in 1997.

The SEDD capture information on ED visits that do not result in an admission (i.e., treat-and-release visits and transfers to another hospital). The SID contain information on patients initially seen in the emergency room and then admitted to the same hospital.

The NEDS contains 25-30 million (unweighted) records for ED visits for over 950 hospitals and approximates a 20-percent stratified sample of U.S. hospital-based EDs.

The NEDS contains information about geographic characteristics, hospital characteristics, patient characteristics, and the nature of visits (e.g., common reasons for ED visits, including injuries).   The NEDS contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).

The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces. Copies of the current survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese, are available on this page. QHP Enrollee Survey reports will be available in 2015.

This analysis will help moderate premium hikes and lower costs for individuals, families, and businesses that buy insurance in these markets. Additionally, insurance companies must provide easy to understand information to their customers about their reasons for unreasonable rate increases, as well as publicly justify and post on their website any unreasonable rate increases. These steps allow consumers to know why they are paying higher rates.

Since 1999, CMS has required Medicare-certified home health agencies to collect and transmit OASIS data for all adult patients whose care is reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid with the exception of patients receiving pre- or postnatal services only. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes including calculating several types of quality reports that are provided to home health agencies to help guide quality and performance improvement efforts. OASIS-C includes data items supporting measurement of rates for use of specific evidence-based care processes. The OASIS-C1 - ICD-9 version went into effect at 1200 a.m. on January 1, 2015 and shall remain in effect until ICD-10 is implemented or until another disposition is made by CMS. The following two categories of quality measures are used in the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP) 1.Outcome measures and 2.Process measures. This site contains brief descriptions of each measure type and how the data for that measure is calculated, it provides links to technical documentation, tables identifying which Home Health Quality Measures are risk-adjusted and reported publicly, and additional resources. Lists of all home health quality measures and designation of which are publicly reported can be found on the Quality Measures page accessed from the list on the left of this page.

BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence of lung transplants in the Medicare population in recent years to aid researchers who develop CED studies of ECP for BOS in determining sample size estimates.

The number and percent of children receiving dental services under Medicaid climbed continuously over the decade. In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.

In that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent.

In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.

These tables are available here for both the Household Component and the Insurance Component. 
Household Component Summary Tables 
The Household Component summary tables provide frequently used summary estimates at the national level on household medical utilization and expenditures: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical care services, charges and payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. Insurance Component Summary Tables 
The Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected. 
MEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November. National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors. State and metro area tables: State-level estimates for the private sector by firm size, industry groupings, ownership type, age of firm, employee characteristics, and average wage quartiles. Metropolitan area private sector estimates of premiums, employee contributions, enrollments, and take-up rates by firm size.

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.

The Mental Health Treatment Locator section of the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator lists facilities providing mental health services to persons with mental illness. It includes:
Public mental health facilities that are funded by their State mental health agency (SMHA) or other State agency or department
Mental health treatment facilities administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Private for-profit and non-profit mental health facilities that are licensed by the State or accredited by a national accreditation organization.

NOTE: The Mental Health Treatment Locator does not include facilities whose primary or only focus is the provision of services to persons with Mental Retardation (MR), Developmental Disability (DD), and Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). Facilities that provide treatment exclusively to persons with mental illness who are incarcerated. Mental health professionals in private practice (individual) or in a small group practice not licensed or certified as a mental health clinic or (community) mental health center.

SAMHSA endeavors to keep the Locator current. All information in the Locator is updated annually based on facility responses to SAMHSA's National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). The most recent complete update includes data collected as of April 30, 2010 in the N-MHSS. New facilities are added monthly. Updates to facility names, addresses, telephone numbers and services are made weekly, if facilities inform SAMHSA of changes.

This study, published in Volume 3, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, reports that, during the study period, only 3.7 percent of Medicaid enrollees moved to another state at least once, and the majority moved only once. Most moves (72.2 percent) were not associated with enrollment gaps, and 8.2 percent of moves were associated with gaps of fewer than three months. Enrollment gaps may indicate a lack of health insurance coverage, resulting in a lack of continuity of care and a risk to patient health outcomes, an increased use of higher cost emergency services, and higher system-wide health care costs. The studys findings provide a benchmark for adjusting national Medicaid statistics to reduce over-counting and improve the corresponding undercount in estimates of the uninsured population, thus, providing a context for further examining the consequences of enrollee moves on their health status and program expenditures.

The goal of this resource is to establish a curated nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent information on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances. The publicly available Registry is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the nanomaterial community, providing data that has been systematically curated based on minimal information standards built with broad community acceptance. It provides a way to tie together different sources of information for a specific nanomaterial and allows users to search and compare characteristic data on different nanomaterials.

The registry provides tools for analyzing and comparing data on the biological and environmental implications of well-characterized nanomaterials. This resource will evolve as the quality and quantity of the information on nanomaterials improve. Hundreds of nanomaterial entries have been curated into the registry for physico-chemical characteristics and are available to the public. Biological and environmental study data for existing nanomaterial entries will also be curated into the registry.

The nanomaterial registry provides the following functions for the research community: basic and advance search through key words or physical and chemical characteristics (PCC); ability to browse nanomaterials based on categories; detailed information about PCC and the biological, and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; display the quality of the characterization of each nanomaterial entry in the form of compliance level that is algorithm based; compare PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; and find similar nanomaterials based on PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials.

Assists investigators in determining whether persons in their studies have died and, if so, provide the names of the states in which those deaths occurred, the dates of death, and the corresponding death certificate numbers. Investigators can then make arrangements with the appropriate state offices to obtain copies of death certificates or specific statistical information such as manner of death or educational level. Cause of death codes may also be obtained using the NDI Plus service.

Records from 1979 through 2011 are currently available and contain a standard set of identifying information on each death. Death records are added to the NDI file annually, approximately 12 months after the end of a particular calendar year. 2012 should be available summer 2014. Early Release Program for 2013 is now available.

The NDI service is available to investigators solely for statistical purposes in medical and health research. The service is not accessible to organizations or the general public for legal, administrative, or genealogy purposes.

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.
NHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.
The NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).
While the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.

NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can compare tools on NITRC and developers can seek and receive help from the community to make their tools more usable and accessible.

The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is part of the federally mandated process for clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes. This process provides a comprehensive assessment of each residents functional capabilities and helps nursing home staff identify health problems. Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPs), are part of this process, and provide the foundation upon which a residents individual care plan is formulated. MDS assessment forms are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes, regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on admission to the nursing facility and then periodically, within specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health care professionals employed by the nursing home. MDS information is transmitted electronically by nursing homes to the MDS database in their respective States. MDS information from the State databases is captured into the national MDS database at CMS. Data from the MDS for 1st quarter 2005 through 3rd quarter 2010 are reported. In future years, this measure will be changing to percentage of long-term nursing facility residents with major falls. The data source will then be MDS 3.0.

PCIP is a temporary program that covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in todays private insurance market. As of May 31, 2011 24,712 Americans had insurance through PCIP and the coverage is making a difference. As of May 31, 2011 data from the federally run PCIP plan shows that of claims paid for the top 20 diagnoses, 30.2 percent were for diagnoses of heart disease and 25.8 percent were for diagnoses of cancer.

Known as the Measures Management System (MMS), this system is composed of a set of business processes and decision criteria that CMS funded measure developers follow in the development, implementation, and maintenance of quality measures. The steps in the measure development process are summarized in the document Quality Measures Development Overview. CMS funded a project to review assessment approaches that could be used across post-acute settings to reduce care fragmentation and unsafe transitions, and to compare outcomes and costs for patients discharged to post acute care. The report entitled Uniform Patient Assessment for Post Acute Care (PAC) Final Report and a stand alone executive summary are available. The overall goal of the Development of Quality Indicators for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) project was to assist CMS in developing appropriate measures to monitor and evaluate the quality of rehabilitation services provided to Medicare beneficiaries in IRFs. The key questions addressed by this report include - What are the expected outcomes of an inpatient rehabilitation stay, What factors affect those outcomes, Do we have appropriate measures of those relationships, And if not, what measures do we need, Funded by CMS, in considering these key questions, Research Triangle Institute (RTI) incorporated expertise from the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation services to develop measures specific to the rehabilitation field that would target these issues while still minimizing the administrative reporting burdens for providers.

,,,"2016-05-02","National Institutes of Health",,"QuitNowTXT Text Messaging Library",,"org:Organization","Department of Health & Human Services",,,,"dcat:Dataset",,,"Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT ""light"" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''¢ Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''¢ Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''¢ Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''¢ Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''¢ Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.

Congress and OMB now use performance information to support budget decisions. Many state and local governments are requiring similar systems of accountability to document results and justify funding.  In order to gather information on the performance of its program, the Administration on Aging surveys the participants in its Older Americans Act programs.

While relatively few adults in Idaho received a wellness exam after such coverage was added, the adoption of managed care for dental services was associated with increased receipt of dental care, including preventive care. New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions.

The independent laboratory market is dominated by two firms, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. The hospital outreach market is not as concentrated as the independent laboratory market.

The purpose of this registry is to assist the public in identifying scientifically based approaches to preventing and treating mental and/or substance use disorders that can be readily disseminated to the field. NREPP is one way that SAMHSA is working to improve access to information on tested interventions and thereby reduce the lag time between the creation of scientific knowledge and its practical application in the field.

NREPP is a voluntary, self-nominating system in which intervention developers elect to participate. There will always be some interventions that are not submitted to NREPP, and not all that are submitted are reviewed. In addition, new intervention summaries are continually being added, so the registry is always growing. Please check back regularly to access the latest updates.

It also provides facility and release details, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and aggregates release data over multiple years. Maps also show locations of Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, listing all chemical contaminants present at these sites.  Two versions of TOXMAP are available: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004, and a new version of TOXMAP based on Adobe® Flash/Flex technology.  The new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities and additional datasets such as EPA coal plant emissions data and U.S. commercial nuclear power plants.

In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.

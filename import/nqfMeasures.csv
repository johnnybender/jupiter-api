m0001,Risk Adjusted Colon Surgery Outcome Measure,0706,"This is a hospital based, risk adjusted, case mix adjusted morbidity and mortality aggregate outcome measure of adults 18+ years undergoing colon surgery.","The outcome of interest is 30-day, hospital-specific risk-adjusted (all cause) mortality, unplanned reoperation, or any of the following morbidities as defined by American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP): cardiac arrest requiring CPR, myocardial Infarction, sepsis, septic shock, deep incisional surgical site infection (SSI), organ space SSI, wound disruption, unplanned reintubation without prior ventilator dependence, pneumonia without pre-operative pneumonia, progressive renal insufficiency or acute renal failure without pre-operative renal failure or dialysis, or urinary tract infection (UTI). All outcomes are definitively resolved within 30 days of any ACS NSQIP listed (CPT) surgical procedure. All variables (fields) are explicitly defined in the tradition of the ACS NSQIP and definitions are also submitted in these materials. The original endorsed measure included venous thromboembolism (VTE) as eligible morbidity events, including deep venous thrombosis requiring therapy and pulmonary embolism.The current set of mortality and major complications for this measure was chosen based on prior work revealing that these complications are related to other important criteria such as large contributions to excess length of stay, large complication burdens, or correlations with mortality. (Merkow et al. 2013) In addition, the desire to limit the outcomes to significant events (ie- some degree of severity according to certain criteria) is the reason that superficial wound infection is excluded from the measure. The current submission removes VTE from the measure as recent publications have demonstrated it is highly subject to surveillance bias. A recent study of 2,838 hospitals found that increased VTE prophylaxis adherence was associated with worse risk-adjusted VTE event rates. (Bilimoria 2013 JAMA) Paradoxically hospitals with higher quality, identified by number of accreditations and quality initiatives, had worse VTE rates. The explanation for this paradoxical relationship is suggested by the association of higher rates of VTE imaging studies among these hospitals with higher rates of VTE detection.

m0003,Hospital 30-Day Risk-Standardized Readmission Rates following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI),0695,"This measure estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) following PCI for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) patients who are 65 years of age or older. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days following hospital stays. The measure includes both patients who are admitted to the hospital (inpatients) for their PCI and patients who undergo PCI without being admitted (outpatient or observation stay). A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. The measure uses clinical data available in the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCDR) CathPCI Registry for risk adjustment and Medicare claims to identify readmissions. Additionally, the measure uses direct patient identifiers including Social Security Number (SSN) and date of birth to link the datasets.A hospital stay is when a patient is admitted to the hospital (inpatient) for PCI or receives a procedure at a hospital, but is not admitted as an inpatient (outpatient).The primary update to this measure since it was last reviewed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) is a more comprehensive specification of planned readmission. Additionally, the updated measure includes a re-specification of variables to reflect changes in the data collection form that occurred when the CathPCI Registry was updated from Version 3.04 (Version 3) to Version 4.3.1 (Version 4). Finally, the measure has been updated to use direct identifiers including SSN and date of birth to link the CathPCI Registry data with corresponding administrative claims data. These updates are described within this application and in the accompanying report re-specifying Hospital 30-Day Readmission Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Measure (see Appendix attachment).","The outcome for this measure is 30-day all-cause readmission. We define readmission as an acute care inpatient hospital admission for any cause, with the exception of certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the discharge date of the index PCI hospitalization or PCI outpatient claim end date (hereafter referred to as discharge). If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, then no readmission is counted, regardless of whether a subsequent unplanned readmission takes place. We use this approach because it would potentially be unfair to attribute an unplanned readmission that follows a planned readmission back to the care received during the initial index admission. For more details on how planned readmissions were identified and removed from the outcome, please refer to the Specifications Report in the attached Appendix.",The target population for this includes hospital stays for patients who are 65 years of age or older who receive a PCI and who have matching records in the CathPCI Registry and Medicare claims.,"The following exclusions were applied to data during the merging of NCDR CathPCI and Medicare datasets:1. Patients younger than 65 years of age.Rationale: Patients younger than 65 in the Medicare dataset represent a distinct population that qualifies for Medicare due to disability. The characteristics and outcomes of these patients may be less representative of the larger population of PCI patients. Additionally, patients younger than 65 in the NCDR CathPCI dataset will not have corresponding data in the Medicare claims dataset to obtain the readmission outcome.2. Patient stays with duplicate fields (NCDR CathPCI and Medicare datasets). Rationale: Two or more patient stays that have identical information for SSN, admission date, discharge date, and hospital MPN are excluded to avoid making matching errors upon merging of the two datasets. 3. Unmatched patient stays. Rationale: The measure requires information from both the CathPCI Registry and corresponding Medicare claims data. Accordingly, the measure cannot be applied to patient stays that are not matched in both datasets.Exclusions applied to the linked dataset:1. Patients not enrolled in Medicare FFS at the start of the episode of care. Rationale: Readmission data are currently available only for Medicare FFS patients.2. Not the first claim in the same claim bundle. Rationale: Multiple claims from an individual hospital can be bundled together. To ensure that the selected PCI is the index PCI, we exclude those PCI procedures that were not the first claim in a specific bundle. Inclusion of additional claims could lead to double counting of an index PCI procedure.3. Instances when PCI is performed more than 10 days following admission. Rationale: Patients who undergo PCI late into their hospitalization represent an unusual clinical situation in which it is less likely that the care delivered at the time of or following the PCI would be reasonably assumed to be associated with subsequent risk of readmission. 4. Transfers out. Rationale: Patient stays in which the patient received a PCI and was then transferred to another hospital are excluded because the hospital that performed the PCI procedure does not provide discharge care and cannot fairly be held responsible for their outcomes following discharge. 5. In-hospital deaths (the patient dies in the hospital).Rationale: Subsequent admissions (readmissions) are not possible.6. Discharges Against Medical Advice (AMA). Rationale: Physicians and hospitals do not have the opportunity to deliver the highest quality care.7. PCI in which 30-day follow-up is not available. Rationale: Patients who are not enrolled for 30 days in fee-for-service Medicare following their hospital stay are excluded because there is not adequate follow-up data to assess readmissions.8. Admissions with a PCI occurring within 30-days of a prior PCI already included in the cohort.Rationale: We do not want to count the same admission as both an index admission and an outcome.",Yes,Outcome,measure,,"Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular: Coronary Artery Disease (PCI)","Care Coordination, Care Coordination: Readmissions, Care Coordination: Transitions of Care, Safety",Inpatient/Hospital,Patient Safety,,"Claims, Registry Data",Facility,"Elderly, Populations at Risk",,,"Dec 14, 2017",Endorsed,1/17/2011 12:00:00 AM,None,,American College of Cardiology,comment@acc.org,,N/A,N/A,

m0020,Measure of Medical Home for Children and Adolescents,0724,"This composite measure assesses whether or not children and adolescents (age 0-17 years) receive health care within a medical home according to the survey respondent (almost always the child’s parent). The medical home measure is based on six of the seven components of care first proposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)—health care that is accessible, family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. (Note: ""accessible"" is the one component of medical home that is not directly addressed in this composite measure. This will be explained in a later section)The AAP policy statement emphasizes that a medical home is “not a building, house, or hospital, but rather an approach to providing continuous and comprehensive primary pediatric care from infancy through young adulthood, with availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from a pediatrician or physician whom families trust,” and this composite measure of medical home is designed to assess the receipt of quality health care using the AAP´s recommended care guidelines.","The Measure of Medical Home for Children Adolescents measures whether or not a child or adolescent is receiving care within a medical home--that is, care that meets all of the following criteria--child has a regular doctor or nurse AND has a usual place for well and sick care AND receives care that is family-centered AND has no problems getting referrals when needed AND receives effective care coordination when needed.","Main denominator: Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. (this measure has only been officially tested on children in the United States and has not been tested for potential cultural differences among other countries). Domain-Specific denominators:• Established relationship with a specific provider:   o Children age 0-17 years in the U.S.• Family-centered/Compassionate:   o Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. who received at least 1 service from a doctor or other health care provider in the past 12 months• Comprehensive:   o Children age 0-17 years in the U.S.• Coordinated:   o K5Q31, K5Q32 : Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. who received at least 1 service from a doctor or other health care provider in the past 12 months   o K5Q20, K5Q21, K5Q22, and K5Q30: Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. who received 2 or more services from a doctor or other health care provider in the past 12 months• Culturally effective:    o K5Q42: Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. who received at least 1 service from a doctor or other health care provider in the past 12 months   o K5Q45 and K5Q46: Children age 0-17 years in the U.S. who speak a primary household language other than English or unknown","The minimum denominator exclusions are: if the child is not between the ages of 0 and 17 years, if the child does not have at least 1 healthcare provider considered to be a personal doctor or nurse, or if the child does not have a usual source for both sick and well-child care, or if the child has not used any health-related services in the past 12 months.

m0021,Proportion of patients with a chronic condition that have a potentially avoidable complication during a calendar year.,0709,"Percent of adult population aged 18+ years who were identified as having at least one of the following six chronic conditions: Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Heart Failure (HF), Hypertension (HTN), or Diabetes Mellitus (DM), were followed for at least one-year, and had one or more potentially avoidable complications (PACs) during the most recent 12 months. Please reference attached document labeled NQF_Chronic_Care_PACs_01_24_17.xls, in the tabs labeled PACs I-9 & I-10 for a list of code definitions of PACs relevant to each of the above chronic conditions.  We define PACs as one of two types: (1) Type 1 PACs - PACs related to the index condition: Patients are considered to have a PAC, if they receive services during the episode time window for any of the complications directly related to the chronic condition, such as for acute exacerbation of the index condition, respiratory insufficiency in patients with Asthma or COPD, hypotension or fluid and electrolyte disturbances in patients with CAD, HF or diabetes etc. (2) Type 2 PACs - PACs related to Patient Safety or broader System Failures: Patients are also considered to have a PAC, if they receive services during the episode time window for any of the complications related to patient safety or health system failures such as for sepsis, infections, phlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores etc. All relevant hospitalizations for patients with chronic conditions are considered potentially avoidable and flagged as PACs. This particularly applies to hospitalizations due to acute exacerbations of the index condition. For example, a hospitalization for diabetic emergency in a diabetic patient, or a hospitalization for acute pulmonary edema in a heart failure patient is considered a PAC.  PACs are counted as a dichotomous (yes/no) outcome.  If a patient had one or more PACs, they get counted as a “yes” or a 1.  The summary tab in the enclosed workbook labeled NQF_Chronic_Care_PACs_01_24_17.xls gives the overview of the frequency and costs associated with each of these types of PACs for each of the six chronic conditions.  Detailed drill-down tabs with graphs are also provided in the same workbook for each of the six chronic conditions to highlight high-frequency PACs. The Decision Tree tabs in the same workbook highlight the flow diagrams for the selection of patients into each chronic condition episode.The information is based on a two-year claims database from a commercial insurer with 3,258,706 covered lives and $25.9 billion in “allowed amounts” for claims costs. The database is an administrative claims database with medical as well as pharmacy claims.It is important to note that while the overall frequency of PAC hospitalizations is low (for all chronic care conditions summed together, PAC frequency was 1.6% for all PAC occurrences), they amount to over 52% of the PAC medical costs.","Outcome: Number of patients with at least one of the following six chronic conditions: Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Heart Failure (HF), Hypertension (HTN), or Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and had one or more potentially avoidable complications (PACs), during the most recent 12 months.","Adult patients aged 18+ years who were identified as having at least one of the following six chronic conditions: Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Heart Failure (HF), Hypertension (HTN), or Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and were followed for at least 12 months.","Patients are excluded from the measure if they are less than 18 years of age, have an incomplete episode of care (less than 18 months of claims), have an enrollment gap of more than 30 days, or have outlier costs for the most recent 12 months of claim costs.Claims are excluded from the episode if they are for services that are not relevant to the chronic condition.",Yes,Outcome,measure,,,"Safety, Safety: Complications","Other, Outpatient Services",Patient Safety,,Claims,"Clinician: Group/Practice, Health Plan, Other, Population: Community, County or City, Population: Regional and State","Populations at Risk, Populations at Risk: Individuals with multiple chronic conditions",,,"Jan 25, 2017",Endorsed,1/17/2011 12:00:00 AM,Endorsement Maintenance,,Altarum Institute,Francois.deBrantes@altarum.org,,,"Evidence-informed Case Rates®, ECR® and PROMETHEUS Payment® are all registered trademarks of Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, Inc (HCI3).

We define PACs during each time period as one of three types:(A)	PACs during the Index Stay (Hospitalization): (1)	PACs related to the anchor condition: The index stay is regarded as having a PAC if during the index hospitalization for stroke the patient develops one or more complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, malignant hypertension, coma, anoxic brain damage, or respiratory failure etc. that may result directly from stroke or its management. (2)	PACs due to Comorbidities: The index stay is also regarded as having a PAC if one or more of the patient’s controlled comorbid conditions is exacerbated during the hospitalization (i.e. it was not present on admission).  Examples of these PACs are diabetic emergency with hypo- or hyperglycemia, pneumonia, lung complications, acute myocardial infarction, gastritis, ulcer, GI hemorrhage etc.(3)	PACs suggesting Patient Safety Failures: The index stay is regarded as having a PAC if there are one or more complications related to patient safety issues. Examples of these PACs are septicemia, meningitis, other infections, phlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or any of the CMS-defined hospital acquired conditions (HACs). (B)	PACs during the 30-day post discharge period:(1)	PACs related to the anchor condition:  Readmissions and emergency room visits during the 30-day post discharge period after a stroke are considered as PACs if they are for hypertensive encephalopathy, malignant hypertension, respiratory failure, coma, anoxic brain damage etc.(2)	PACs due to Comorbidities: Readmissions and emergency room visits during the 30-day post discharge period are also considered PACs if they are due to an exacerbation of one or more of the patient’s comorbid conditions, such as a diabetic emergency with hypo- or hyperglycemia, pneumonia, lung complications, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure etc. (3)	PACs suggesting Patient Safety Failures: Readmissions or emergency room visits during the 30-day post discharge period are considered PACs if they are due to sepsis, infections, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or for any of the CMS-defined hospital acquired conditions (HACs).The enclosed workbook labeled NQF_Stroke_PACs_Risk_Adjustment_2.16.10.xls, gives the frequency and costs associated with each of these types of PACs during the index hospitalization (tab labeled CIP_Index PAC_Stays) and for readmissions and emergency room visits during the 30-day post-discharge period (tab labeled CIP_PAC_Readmission).  The information is based on a two-year national commercially insured population (CIP) claims database.

Please reference the attached document labeled NQF_PNE_all_codes_risk_adjustment_12_14_15.xls, in the tab labeled PACS I-9 & I-10 for a list of code definitions of PACs relevant to pneumonia.  Community Acquired Pneumonia may be managed in an inpatient setting, where the patient is admitted to a hospital within 1-3 days of onset of symptoms, or in milder cases, patients may be hospitalized a little later in the course of illness, or never at all where management could be solely in an outpatient setting.  In any of these circumstances, potentially avoidable complications (PACs) may occur during the index stay, in the post-discharge period; or in patients who were never hospitalized, PACs may occur any time during the episode time window. Readmissions due to pneumonia or due to any related diagnosis are also considered as PACs.   We define PACs as one of two types: (1) Type 1 PACs - PACs directly related to the index condition: Patients are considered to have a type 1 PAC if they develop one or more complication directly related to pneumonia or its management. Examples of these PACs are respiratory insufficiency, other lung complications, fluid electrolyte acid base problems, sepsis, respiratory failure etc.  (2) Type 2 PACs - PACs suggesting Patient Safety Failures: Patients are considered to have a type 2 PAC, if they develop any of the complications related to patient safety failures such as phlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores or for any of the CMS-defined hospital acquired conditions (HACs). PACs are counted as a dichotomous (yes/no) outcome.

m0030,Patient Experience of Psychiatric Care as Measured by the Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS),0726,"The Patient Experience of Psychiatric Care as Measure by the Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS) was developed to gather patient´s evaluation of their inpatient psychiatric care. The survey is composed of the following six individual measures or domains: Measure #1: Outcome of care- The receipt of mental healthcare services should enable patients to effectively deal with their illness and with social situations. Patient´s report of the effectiveness of the organization in enabling this improvement is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization. The following questions of the ICS pertain to the Outcome of care domain: Q1.I am able to deal with crisis.; Q2. My symptoms are not bothering me as much.; Q4. I do better in social situations.; and Q5. I deal more effectively with daily problems.Measure #2: Dignity- The provision of mental healthcare services should be in an atmosphere where patients feel respected and treated with dignity. Patient´s report of the effectiveness of the organization in providing this respectful exchange is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization. The following questions of the ICS pertain to the Dignity domain: Q6. I was treated with dignity and respect.; Q7. Staff here believe that I can grow, change and recover.; Q8. I felt comfortable asking questions about my treatment and medications.; and Q9. I was encouraged to use self-help/support groups.    Measure #3: Rights- The provision of mental healthcare services should be in an atmosphere where patients feel that they can express disapproval with conditions or treatment and receive an appropriate response from the organization. Patient´s report of the effectiveness of the organization in providing this respectful exchange is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization. The following questions of the ICS pertain to the Rights domain: Q13. I felt free to complain without fear of retaliation.; Q14. I felt safe to refuse medication or treatment during my hospital stay.; and Q15. My complaints and grievances were addressed.Measure #4: Participation in treatment- Patient´s involvement in the treatment process and the coordination of discharge planning with their doctors or therapist from the community are enabling activities that strengthen patient´s ability to care for themselves. Patient´s report of the effectiveness of the organization in supporting this level of involvement is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization. The following questions of the ICS pertain to the Participation in treatment domain: Q16. I participated in planning my discharge.; Q17. Both I and my doctor or therapist from the community were actively involved in my hospital treatment plan.; and Q18. I had the opportunity to talk with my doctor or therapist from the community prior to discharge.Measure #5: Hospital environment - The provision of mental healthcare services should be in an environment conducive to patients feeling safe and enabling patients to focus on recovering from their illness. The following questions of the ICS pertain to the Hospital environment domain: Q19. The surroundings and atmosphere at the hospital helped me get better.; Q20. I felt I had enough privacy in the hospital.; Q21. I felt safe while in the hospital.; and Q22. The hospital environment was clean and comfortable. Measure #6: Empowerment - The provision of mental healthcare services should be in an atmosphere where patients feel that they, interactively with their doctors and therapist, learn more about their illness and about their treatment options and are encouraged to determine their best plan to recovery. Patient´s report of the effectiveness of the organization in enabling this respectful, compassionate, and supportable encounter among patients and healthcare professionals is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization. The following questions pertain to the Hospital empowerment domain: Q25. I had a choice of treatment options.; Q26. My contact with my doctor was helpful.; and, Q27. My contact with nurses and therapist was helpful.Question 28, ""If I had a choice of hospitals, I would still choose this one"", is considered as the anchor item utilized to measure overall satisfaction with the mental healthcare service received. This question does not pertain to any of the six measures/domains of the ICS.Each measure is scored as the percentage of patients (adolescents aged 13-17 and adults aged 18 and older) at time of discharge or at annual review who respond positively to the domain on the survey for a given month. Survey questions are based on a standard 5-point Likert scale, evaluated on a scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree.As a note, the words domain and measure are used interchangeably during the application.","Number of patients who respond positively to the domain (outcome of care, dignity, rights, participation in treatment, hospital environment, and empowerment.) Each domain is calculated separately.Six domains are embedded in the ICS. Hospitals can choose to participate in any of the six performance measures, one for each domain. The outcome of care domain includes questions about the effect of the hospital stay on the patient´s ability to deal with their illness and with social situations. The dignity domain includes questions about the quality of interactions between staff and patients that highlight a respectful relationship. The rights domain includes questions about the ability of patients to express disapproval with conditions or treatment and receive an appropriate response from the organization. The participation in treatment domain includes questions about patient´s involvement in their hospital treatment as well as coordination with the patient´s doctor or therapist from the community. The hospital environment includes questions about feeling safe in the hospital and the aesthetics of the hospital. The empowerment domain includes questions about patients having a choice of treatment options and about the helpfulness of their contact with their doctor or therapist.","Number of patients completing at least 2 questions included in the domain.

m0036,Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC),0722,"The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a brief parent-report questionnaire that is used to assess overall psychosocial functioning in children from 3 to 18 years of age. Originally developed to be a screen that would allow pediatricians and other health professionals to identify children with poor overall functioning who were in need of further evaluation or referral, the PSC has seen such wide use in large systems that it has increasingly been used as a quality indicator and as an outcome measure to assess changes in functioning over time. In addition to the original 35 item parent report form of the PSC in English, there are now many other validated forms including translations of the original form into about two dozen other languages, a youth self-report, a pictorial version, and a briefer 17 item version for both the parent and youth forms.","The PSC is an outcome and a process measure.

m0049,Unexpected Complications in Term Newborns,0716,"This is a hospital level performance score reported as the percent of infants with Unexpected Newborn Complications among full term newborns with no preexisting conditions, typically calculated per year.","Numerator:  The numerator is divided into two categories: Severe complications and moderate complications. Severe complications include neonatal death, transfer to another hospital for higher level of care, extremely low Apgar Scores (=3 at either 5 or 10 minutes of life), severe birth injuries such as intracranial hemorrhage or nerve injury, neurologic damage, severe respiratory and infectious complications such as sepsis. Parents of such babies may often worry about short or long term infant outcomes.  Moderate complications include diagnoses or procedures that raise concern but at a lower level than the list for severe (e.g. use of CPAP or bone fracture). For inclusion in the numerator, most require an infant length of stay that exceeds that of the mother, validating that these are indeed significant complications. Examples include less severe respiratory complications (e.g. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn), or infections with a longer length of stay not including sepsis. As a “safety net” to capture cases who were under-coded, the numerator also includes infants who have a prolonged length of stay of over 5 days to capture the “seemingly normal” infants with neither any form of jaundice nor a social reason for staying in the hospital (e.g. family disruption or adoption).","The denominator is comprised of singleton, live born babies who are at least 37.0 weeks of gestation, and over 2500g in birth weight. The denominator excludes most serious fetal conditions that are “preexisting” (present before labor), including prematurity, multiple gestations, poor fetal growth, congenital malformations, genetic disorders, other specified fetal and maternal conditions and infants exposed to maternal drug use in-utero. The final denominator population consists of babies who are expected to do well following labor and delivery and go home routinely with their mothers.","a) Babies not born in hospitals are excluded as this is a hospital quality performance measureb) Babies who are part of multiple gestation pregnancies are excluded.c) Premature infants (babies born before 37 weeks gestational age) are excludedd) Low birth weight babies (<=2500g) are excluded e) Babies with congenital malformations and genetic diseases are excludedf) Babies with pre-existing fetal conditions such as IUGR are excludedg) Babies who were exposed to maternal drug use in-utero are excluded",No,Outcome,measure,"Hospital Compare, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting","Perinatal Health, Perinatal Health: Newborn Care",Safety: Complications,Inpatient/Hospital,Health and Well-Being,"Public Health/Disease Surveillance, Public Reporting, Quality Improvement (external benchmarking to organizations), Quality Improvement (Internal to the specific organization)",Claims,"Facility, Integrated Delivery System, Population: Regional and State","Children, Women",,,"Oct 25, 2016",Endorsed,1/17/2011 12:00:00 AM,Annual Update,,California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative,main@cmqcc.org,,,This will be in the public domain.,

m0052,Percent of Residents or Patients Who Were Assessed and Appropriately Given the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (short stay),0680,"The measure reports the percentage of short-stay residents or patients who are assessed and appropriately given the seasonal influenza vaccine during the most recently-completed influenza season. The influenza vaccination season (IVS) is defined as beginning on October 1, or when the vaccine first becomes available*, and ends on March 31 of the following year. This measure is based on the NQF´s National Voluntary Standards for Influenza and Pneumococcal Immunizations.The measure is the aggregate of three separately calculated submeasures to reflect the process by which a resident or patient is assessed and appropriately given the influenza vaccination during the current or most recent influenza season. The three submeasures are as follows: •	residents or patients who received the influenza vaccine during the most recently completed influenza season, either in the facility/hospital or outside the facility/hospital (NQF #0680a); •	residents or patients who were offered and declined the seasonal influenza vaccine (NQF #0680b); •	residents or patients who were ineligible to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine due to contraindication(s) (e.g., anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the vaccine, see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax-summary.htm ) (NQF #0680c).*Note: While the IVS officially begins when the vaccine becomes available, which may be before October 1, the denominator time window for the quality measure and references to the IVS for the denominator specification is from October 1 to March 31 of the following year.  The numerator time window and references to the IVS in the numerator specifications may include patients and residents who are assessed and offered the vaccine before October 1. This is based on how the influenza items were coded by the facility.The denominator consists of patients or short-stay residents 180 days of age or older on the target date of assessment who were in the facility/hospital for at least one day during the most recently-completed influenza vaccination season (IVS). The measure is based on data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments of nursing home residents, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) assessments for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) patients, and the Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH) Continuity Assessment Record & Evaluation (CARE) Data Set Version assessments of LTCH patients.Data are collected in each of these three settings using standardized items across the three assessment instruments. For the nursing homes, the measure is limited to short-stay residents, identified as residents who have had 100 or fewer days of nursing home care. For the LTCHs, this measure will include all patients, irrespective of a patient’s length of stay. For IRFs, this measure includes all Medicare Part A and Part C patients, irrespective of a patient’s length of stay.","The numerator for the overall measure (NQF #0680) is the number of residents or patients in the denominator sample who, during the numerator time window, meet any one of the following criteria: (1) those who received the seasonal influenza vaccine during the most recently-completed influenza season, either in the facility/hospital or outside the facility/hospital (NQF #0680a); (2) those who were offered and declined the seasonal influenza vaccine (NQF #0680b); or (3) those who were ineligible due to contraindication(s) (NQF #0680c). The numerator time window coincides with the most recently-completed seasonal IVS which begins on October 1 and ends on March 31 of the following year.  Each of the three submeasures numerators described above will be computed and reportedly separately, alongside the overall numerator calculated as the aggregate of the three submeasure numerators.","The denominator consists of patients or short-stay residents 180 days of age and older on the target date of the assessment who were in the facility/hospital for at least one day during the denominator time window. The denominator time window is defined as the most recently-completed IVS, from October 1 to March 31 of the following year. For IRF and LTCH, the QM is based on completed patient stays (have discharge assessments). An IRF or LTCH patient with multiple stays during the denominator time window (IVS) will be included more than once in the QM. If a nursing home resident has more than one episode during the denominator time window only the more recent episode is included in this QM.","Residents or patients whose age is 179 days of less of age on target date of the selected influenza vaccination assessment are excluded.

The measure is the aggregate of three separately calculated submeasures to reflect the process by which a resident is assessed and appropriately given the influenza vaccination during the current or most recent influenza season. The three submeasures are as follows: •	resident received the influenza vaccine during the current or most recent influenza season, either in the facility or outside the facility (NQF #0681a); •	resident was offered and declined the seasonal influenza vaccine (NQF #0681b); and •	resident was ineligible to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine due to contraindication(s) (e.g., anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the vaccine, see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax-summary.htm) (NQF #0681c). The denominator consists of long-stay residents 180 days of age or older on the target date of assessment who were in the facility for at least one day during the most recently-completed influenza vaccination season (IVS). This measure is based on data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS 3.0) OBRA, PPS, and/or discharge assessments during the selected influenza season. Long-stay residents are identified as those who have had 101 or more cumulative days of nursing facility care.A separate measure (NQF #0680, Percent of Residents or Patients Who Were Assessed and Appropriately Given the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (short stay)) is to be used for residents who have had 100 or fewer cumulative days of nursing facility care.","The numerator is the number of long-stay residents with a target assessment (OBRA admission, quarterly, annual or significant change/correction assessments; PPS 5-,14-, 30-, 60-, 90-day, or readmission/return assessments; or discharge assessment with or without return anticipated) who were in the denominator sample, AND who meet any of the following criteria for the selected influenza season: (1) they received the influenza vaccine during the most recent influenza season, either in the facility or outside the facility (NQF #0681a), (2) they were offered and declined the influenza vaccine (NQF #0681b), or (3) they were ineligible due to medical contraindication(s) (NQF #0681c) .

m0067,Percent of Residents or Patients Assessed and Appropriately Given the Pneumococcal Vaccine (Short-Stay),0682,"The measure reports the percentage of short stay nursing home residents or IRF or LTCH patients who were assessed and appropriately given the pneumococcal vaccine during the 12-month reporting period. This measure is based on data from Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessments of nursing home residents, the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) for IRF patients, and the Long Term Care Hospital (LTCH) Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) Data Set for long-term care hospital patients, using items that have been harmonized across the three assessment instruments. Short-stay nursing home residents are those residents who are discharged within the first 100 days of their nursing home stay.The NQF standard specifications were harmonized to achieve a uniform approach to measurement across settings and populations, addressing who is included in or excluded from the target denominator population, who is included in the numerator population, and the time windows. In 2008, the NQF steering committee met to identify voluntary consensus measures for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination that were harmonized across healthcare settings. The steering committee recognized that “in the interest of standardization and minimizing burden for those implementing and using measures, measure harmonization is an important consideration in evaluating and recommending measures for endorsement.” The committee supported the use of measure IM-017-which reports the percent of nursing home/Skilled Nursing Facility residents whose pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) status is up to date during the 12-month reporting period - as the basis for a harmonized measure across settings (National Quality Forum, 2008b). The NQF standardized specifications differ from the currently reported measure in several ways. Note that for some residents or patients, a single vaccination during their lifetime is sufficient and the vaccination would be considered up to date; for others (those who are immunocompromised or older than age 65, but the first vaccine was administered more than 5 years before when the resident was younger than 65), a second dose would be needed to qualify as vaccination up to date. Although the guidelines recommend a second dose in these circumstances, the NQF Committee believed that adding that requirement would make measurement too complex for the amount of benefit gained. Also, given the importance of revaccination among older adults, focusing on up-to-date status, rather than on ever having received the vaccine, is critically important. This focus on up-to-date rather than ever having received a vaccination is supported by the NQF steering committee in their discussion of the national voluntary consensus standards for this measure (National Quality Forum, 2008a).This measure will include only residents or patients aged 5 years and older in the denominator. In their 2008  review of voluntary consensus standards for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination the NQF steering committee recommended limiting the use of measure  IM -017 which reports the percent of nursing home/Skilled Nursing Facility residents whose PPV status is up to date, to residents age 5 and older.  They state in their recommendation, “the specifications for high-risk groups begin at age 5, because the schedule for children ages 2-5 is different and complicated.” (National Quality Forum. 2008b) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides age specific guidelines for pneumococcal immunization for both children and adults. These guidelines vary based on age and risk level and should be followed accordingly. Up–to-date vaccination status is defined as a resident or patient who has been vaccinated in accordance with the current CDC vaccination guidelines for pneumococcal disease for his/her age and health status.

Late-loss ADL items are bed mobility, transfer, eating, and toilet use. The threshold increase in need for assistance (suggesting decline in function) that results in a resident being counted in the numerator is met if the score for at least one late-loss ADL item increases by two or more points or if the score for two or more of the late-loss ADLs items increase by one point.

m0076,Radiation Dose of Computed Tomography (CT),0739,"The measure requires hospitals and output facilities that conduct Computed Tomography (CT) studies to assess the radiation dose associated with the most frequently conducted examination types – CT’s of the head, chest, abdomen/pelvis obtained in children and adults. The measure provides a simple framework for how facilities can assess their dose, a framework that currently does not exist. By assessing their doses, facilities can monitor the doses they use over time and compare their doses to benchmarks. The creation of benchmarks is not part of this measure per se. However, if facilities use this measure, I believe professional societies, researchers, and oversight organizations can separately create their benchmarks. Several research groups, including my own, have published benchmarks and published manuscripts that have used the framework of this measure to assess changes in radiation dose over time (Keagan, JACR, 2014) and to assess the impact of an educational intervention  on doses, using the specifications of the measure to assess the results of a randomized trial (Miglioretti, JACR, 2014). This measure was initially developed for diagnostic CT, but can equally be used for CT used in conjunction with radiation therapy for cancer. Professional organizations within various medical specialties can create appropriate benchmarks depending on the application.","Radiation Dose, quantified using the distribution in four dose metrics (DLP, CTDIvol, SSDE, ED); within anatomic area, age, and machine-type strata. SSDE only pertains to abdomen scans.These different metrics are highly correlated, but nonetheless reveal important differences regarding radiology practice and performance and are thus complimentary. However, if a practice only generates dose metrics for a single metric, there is a lot of information and performance information to be gleaned.CTDIvol will reveal the settings used per small scan length. This is directly generated by most modern CT scanners.DLP reflects both the dose per small scan length, but also the length of scan that is conducted, and is defined as CTDIvol x scan length. This is directly generated by most modern CT scanners.Effective dose takes into account the total amount of radiation emitted from the machine as well the radio-sensitivity to developing cancer in the area radiated. The measure thus combines both radiation dose and future cancer risk. The metric is the only one that can be combined across types of studies and anatomic areas and is thus useful for dose monitoring dose surveillance and facility performance (see Smith-Bindman, Radiology, 2011).While there are many different ways to calculate Effective Dose, and many current dose monitoring software products can do this automatically, a simple rule of thumb can be used to convert DLP to Effective dose in adults (see Huda, below). In the brain, given typical machine settings that are used, the DLP can be converted to Effective Dose by multiplying DLP measured in mGy-Cm by 0.002 to yield Effective Dose measured in milli-Sieverts. Effective Dose of CT scans though the chest can be estimated by multiplying the DLP measured in mGy-cm by .017 to yield Effective Dose measurements in mSv; and Effective Dose of abdominal and pelvis CT can be estimated by multiplying DLP by 0.18. It is not clear that using greater precision in the quantification of effective dose is necessary for the quality improvement purposes outlined in this measure.Additional relevant citations for effective doseSmith-Bindman R, Miglioretti DL.

Readmission is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years and older and are Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal hospitals or Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, with the exception of certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from the index HF admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admissions (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not counted as an outcome for that index admission, because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.Additional details are provided in S.5 Numerator Details.","This claims-based measure can be used in either of two patient cohorts: (1) patients aged 65 years or older or (2) patients aged 18 years or older. The cohort includes admissions for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal discharge diagnosis of HF and with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. The measure is currently publicly reported by CMS for those patients 65 years and older who are Medicare FFS beneficiaries admitted to non-federal hospitals. This measure can also be used for an all-payer population aged 18 years and older.

These measure exception categories are not uniformly relevant across all measures; for each measure, there must be a clear rationale to permit an exception for a medical, patient, or system reason.  For measure ´Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CAP): Empiric Antibiotic´, exceptions may include medical reason(s), patient reason(s) or system reason(s) for not prescribing appropriate empiric antibiotic. Although this methodology does not require the external reporting of more detailed exception data, the PCPI recommends that physicians document the specific reasons for exception in patients’ medical records for purposes of optimal patient management and audit-readiness.  The PCPI also advocates the systematic review and analysis of each physician’s exceptions data to identify practice patterns and opportunities for quality improvement.

m0307,Change in Basic Mobility as Measured by the AM-PAC:,0429,"The Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) is a functional status assessment instrument developed specifically for use in facility and community dwelling post acute care (PAC) patients.  It was built using Item Response Theory (IRT) methods to achieve feasible, practical, and precise measurement of functional status (Hambleton 200, Hambleton 2005). Based on factor analytic work and IRT analyses, a Basic Mobility domain has been identified which consists of functional tasks that cover in the following areas:  transfers, walking, wheelchair skills, stairs, bend/lift/ and carrying tasks. (Haley, 2004, 2004a, 2004b). The AM-PAC adaptive short form (ASF) versions of the Basic Mobility scale are being submitted to The National Quality Forum. The ASF version of the Basic Mobility scale consists of 2 different 10-item forms, one for inpatients versus those receiving care in a community setting. Built using IRT methods, the Basic Mobility ASFs allow different questions to be targeted to each setting (inpatient/community), generating an interval level score that is common across both ASFs.  The scale is transformed from a logit scale to a standardized scale which ranges from 0 - 100 where 100 is the best possible mobility function. We believe that these short forms are the best compromise between needed breadth of functional content across inpatient and community functional tasks, and the need to minimize response burden.  The ASFs for Basic Mobility were built from an item bank that contains a rich assortment of 131 calibrated items that have been developed, tested, calibrated and applied in clinical research over the past seven years.  In developing and evaluating the AM-PAC, we employed two different samples of 1081 patients who received post acute care in acute inpatient rehabilitation units, long-term care hospitals, skilled nursing homes, home health care, and outpatient therapy care settings. The ASFs were developed on an initial sample of 485 post acute care patients (see Haley et al, 2004)The existence of a detailed item bank enables the basic AM-PAC forms to be enhanced and improved in a very timely fashion (Jette et al, 2007, Haley et al, 2008) for  examples of this process). Scoring estimates from the ASFs and the computer adaptive test (CAT) are directly comparable, given they are taken from the same item bank, the same IRT analysis and use the same scoring metric.  Using computer simulations with the AM-PAC item bank, we demonstrated excellent scoring comparability between the AM-PAC adaptive short forms and the CAT. (Haley et al., 2004)  Advantages of using the CAT over the short forms include: less test burden on patients, decreased standard errors around score estimates, and improved scoring accuracy at the lower and higher ends of the AM-PAC functional scales. (Haley et al., 2004) However, the adaptive short forms can generate sufficiently accurate scores on the AM-PAC functional domains and those scores can be directly compared to scores provided from a CAT application of the same item pool. ______________________________________________ Cella D, Gershon R, Lai J-S, Choi S.

The percentage threshold is derived from a normative database used for benchmarking.   MDC is considered the minimal amount of change that is not likely to be due to  measurement error.

m0308,Change in Daily Activity Function as Measured by the AM-PAC:,0430,"The Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) is a functional status assessment instrument developed specifically for use in facility and community dwelling post acute care (PAC) patients.  It was built using Item Response Theory (IRT) methods to achieve feasible, practical, and precise measurement of functional status (Hambleton 2000, Hambleton 2005). Based on factor analytic work and IRT analyses, a Daily Activity domain has been identified which consists of functional tasks that cover in the following areas:  feeding, meal preparation, hygiene, grooming, and dressing (Haley, 2004, 2004a, 2004b). The AM-PAC adaptive short form (ASF) versions of the Daily Activity scale are being submitted to The National Quality Forum. The ASF version of the Daily Activity scale consists of 2 different 10-item forms, one for inpatients versus those receiving care in a community setting. Built using IRT methods, the Daily Activity ASFs allow different questions to be targeted to each setting (inpatient/community), generating an interval level score that is common across both ASFs.  The scale is transformed from a logit scale to a standardized scale which ranges from 0 - 100 where 100 is the best possible daily activity function. We believe that these short forms are the best compromise between needed breadth of functional content across inpatient and community functional tasks, and the need to minimize response burden.  The ASFs for Daily Activity were built from an item bank that contains a rich assortment of 88 calibrated items that have been developed, tested, and applied in clinical research over the past seven years.  In developing and evaluating the AM-PAC, we employed two different samples of 1,081 patients who received post acute care in acute inpatient rehabilitation units, long-term care hospitals, skilled nursing homes, home health care, and outpatient therapy care settings. The ASFs were developed on an initial sample of 485 post acute care patients (see Coster et al., 2004).The existence of a detailed item bank enables the basic AM-PAC forms to be enhanced and improved in a very timely fashion (Jette et al., 2007; Haley et al., 2008 for  examples of this process). Scoring estimates from the ASFs and the computer adaptive test (CAT) are directly comparable, given they are taken from the same item bank, the same IRT analysis and use the same scoring metric.  Using computer simulations with the AM-PAC item bank, we demonstrated excellent scoring comparability between the AM-PAC adaptive short forms and the CAT (Haley et al., 2004).  Advantages of using the CAT over the short forms include: less test burden on patients, decreased standard errors around score estimates, and improved scoring accuracy at the lower and higher ends of the AM-PAC functional scales (Haley et al., 2004). However, the ASFs can generate sufficiently accurate scores on the AM-PAC Daily Activity domains and those scores can be directly compared to scores provided from a CAT application of the same item pool. ______________________________________________ Coster WJ, Haley SM, Andres PL, Ludlow LH, Bond TLY, Ni PS (2004).

The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years and older and are Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal hospitals.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day all-cause readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, except for certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from the index AMI admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, then no readmission is counted, regardless of whether a subsequent unplanned readmission takes place. This is because it is not clear whether such readmissions are appropriately attributed to the original index admission or the intervening planned readmission.Additional details are provided in S.5 Numerator Details.","This claims-based measure can be used in either of two patient cohorts: (1) patients aged 65 years or older or (2) patients aged 18 years or older.

AHRQ and CMS supported the development of the Home Health CAHPS to measure the experiences of those receiving home health care with these three goals in mind: (1) to produce comparable data on patients´ perspectives on care that allow objective and meaningful comparisons between home health agencies on domains that are important to consumers, (2) to create incentives for agencies to improve their quality of care through public reporting of survey results, and (3) to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of care provided in return for public investment.  As home health agencies begin to collect these data and as they are publicly reported, consumers will have information to make more informed decisions about care and publicly reporting the data will drive quality improvement in these areas.","The numerator statement is that each measure encompasses the responses for all questions in the particular measure.  Missing data for individual survey questions are not included in the calculations.  Only data from a completed survey are used in the calculations.  The measures scores averages the proportion of those responding to each answer choice in all questions.

Of note, the 6 month period prior to the measurement year is needed to identify new ACE/ARB users and the measurement year is used to calculate MPR.Step 1:  Check if the member received at least one prescription of ACE/ARB in the measurement year.  If no prescription had been received set MPR = 0 and TERMINATE PROGRAM.  Otherwise proceed to Step 2.Of note, this step would identify members who did not receive any ACE/ARB at all during the measurement year as members with MPR = 0.Step 2: Check if the members received a least one prescription of ACE/ARB during the 6 month period prior to the beginning of the measurement year.

These measure exception categories are not uniformly relevant across all measures; for each measure, there must be a clear rationale to permit an exception for a medical, patient, or system reason.  Examples are provided in the measure exception language of instances that may constitute an exception and are intended to serve as a guide to clinicians.  For this measure, exceptions may include medical reason(s) (eg, patient has co-morbid condition that warrants imaging, other medical reasons) or system reason(s) for ordering diagnostic imaging studies (eg, requirement for clinical trial enrollment, ordered by another provider, other system reasons).  Where examples of exceptions are included in the measure language, value sets for these examples are developed and are included in the eSpecifications.  Although this methodology does not require the external reporting of more detailed exception data, the PCPI recommends that physicians document the specific reasons for exception in patients’ medical records for purposes of optimal patient management and audit-readiness.

m0605,HCAHPS,0166,"HCAHPS (NQF #0166) is a 32-item survey instrument that produces 11 publicly reported measures: 7 multi-item measures (communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain control, communication about medicines, discharge information and care transition); and 4 single-item measures (cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, overall rating of the hospital, and recommendation of hospital)","The HCAHPS Survey asks recently discharged patients about aspects of their hospital experience that they are uniquely suited to address. The core of the survey contains 21 items that ask “how often” or whether patients experienced a critical aspect of hospital care, rather than whether they were “satisfied” with their care.  Also included in the survey are four screener items that direct patients to relevant questions, five items to adjust for the mix of patients across hospitals, and two items that support Congressionally-mandated reports. Hospitals may include additional questions after the core HCAHPS items.   HCAHPS is administered to a random sample of adult inpatients between 48 hours and six weeks after discharge. Patients admitted in the medical, surgical and maternity care service lines are eligible for the survey; HCAHPS is not restricted to Medicare beneficiaries. Hospitals may use an approved survey vendor or collect their own HCAHPS data if approved by CMS to do so. HCAHPS can be implemented in four survey modes: mail, telephone, mail with telephone follow-up, or active interactive voice recognition (IVR), each of which requires multiple attempts to contact patients. Hospitals must survey patients throughout each month of the year. IPPS hospitals must achieve at least 300 completed surveys over four calendar quarters. For full details, see the current HCAHPS Quaility Assurance Guiedlines, V.9.0, pp. 49-55, athttp://www.hcahpsonline.org/qaguidelines.aspx","Eligibility for the HCAHPS SurveyThe HCAHPS Survey is broadly intended for patients of all payer types who meet the following criteria: ?	Eighteen (18) years or older at the time of admission?	Admission includes at least one overnight stay in the hospital  •	An overnight stay is defined as an inpatient admission in which the patient´s admission date is different from the patient´s discharge date. The admission need not be 24 hours in length. For example, a patient had an overnight stay if he or she was admitted at 11:00 PM on Day 1, and discharged at 10:00 AM on Day 2. Patients who did not have an overnight stay should not be included in the sample frame (e.g., patients who were admitted for a short period of time solely for observation; patients admitted for same day diagnostic tests as part of outpatient care).?	Non-psychiatric MS-DRG/principal diagnosis at discharge Note: Patients whose principal diagnosis falls within the Maternity Care, Medical, or Surgical service lines and who also have a secondary psychiatric diagnosis are still eligible for the survey.  ?	Alive at the time of dischargeNote: Pediatric patients (under 18 years old at admission) and patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis are ineligible because the current HCAHPS instrument is not designed to address the unique situation of pediatric patients and their families, or the behavioral health issues pertinent to psychiatric patients. Exclusions from the HCAHPS SurveyThere is a two-stage process for determining whether a discharged patient can be included in the HCAHPS Sample Frame. The first stage is to determine whether the discharged patient meets the HCAHPS eligibility criteria, listed above. If the patient meets the eligibility criteria, then a second set of criteria is applied: Exclusions from the HCAHPS Survey.Patients who meet the eligible population criteria outlined above are to be included in the HCAHPS Sample Frame. However, there are a few categories of otherwise eligible patients who are excluded from the sample frame. These are:   ?	“No-Publicity” patients – Patients who request that they not be contacted (see below)?	Court/Law enforcement patients (i.e., prisoners); this does not include patients residing in halfway houses?	Patients with a foreign home address (the U.S. territories – Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands are not considered foreign addresses and therefore, are not excluded)?	Patients discharged to hospice care (Hospice-home or Hospice-medical facility)?	Patients who are excluded because of state regulations ?	Patients discharged to nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities “No-Publicity” patients are defined as those who voluntarily sign a “no-publicity” request while hospitalized or who directly request a survey vendor or hospital not to contact them (“Do Not Call List”). These patients should be excluded from the HCAHPS Survey. However, documentation of patients’ “no-publicity” status must be retained for a minimum of three years.Court/Law enforcement patients (i.e., prisoners) are excluded from HCAHPS because of both the logistical difficulties in administering the survey to them in a timely manner, and regulations governing surveys of this population. These individuals can be identified by the admission source (UB-04 field location 15) “8 – Court/Law enforcement,” patient discharge status code (UB-04 field location 17) “21 – Discharged/transferred to court/law enforcement,” or patient discharge status code “87 – Discharged/transferred to court/law enforcement with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission.” This does not include patients residing in halfway houses.Patients with a foreign home address are excluded from HCAHPS because of the logistical difficulty and added expense of calling or mailing outside of the United States (the U.S. territories - Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands are not considered foreign addresses and therefore, are not excluded).Patients discharged to hospice care are excluded from HCAHPS because of the heightened likelihood that they will expire before the survey process can be completed. Patients with a “Discharge Status” of “50 – Hospice – home” or “51 – Hospice – medical facility” would not be included in the sample frame. “Discharge Status” is the same as the UB-04 field location 17.Some state regulations place further restrictions on patients who may be contacted after discharge. It is the responsibility of the hospital/survey vendor to identify any applicable regulations and to exclude those patients as required by law or regulation in the state in which the hospital operates. Patients discharged to nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities are excluded from HCAHPS. This applies to patients with a “Discharge Status” (UB-04 field location 17) of:?	“03 – Skilled nursing facility”?	“61 – SNF Swing bed within hospital”?	“64 – Certified Medicaid nursing facility”?	“83 – Skilled nursing facility with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission”?	“92 – Certified Medicaid nursing facility with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission”Hospitals/Survey vendors must retain documentation that verifies all exclusions and ineligible patients. This documentation is subject to review.Note: Patients must be included in the HCAHPS Survey sample frame unless the hospital/ survey vendor has positive evidence that a patient is ineligible or fits within an excluded category. If information is missing on any variable that affects survey eligibility when the sample frame is constructed, the patient must be included in the sample frame. For more details, see HCAHPS Quality Assurance Guidelines V9.0 (QAG V9.0), pp. 49-68 at http://www.hcahpsonline.org/qaguidelines.aspx","There is a two-stage process for determining whether a discharged patient can be included in the HCAHPS Sample Frame.

m0750,Bereaved Family Survey,1623,"The purpose of this measure is to assess families´ perceptions of the quality of care that Veterans received from the VA in the last month of life.  The BFS consists of 19 items (17 structured and 2 open-ended).  The BFS items were selected from a longer survey that was developed and validated with the support of a VA HSR&D Merit Award and have been approved for use by the Office of Management and Budget.  Seventeen items in the survey have predefined response options and ask family members to rate aspects of the care that the Veteran received from the VA in the last month of life.  These items cover areas of care such as communication, emotional and spiritual support.  Two additional items are open-ended and give family members the opportunity to provide comments regarding the care the patient received.  A growing body of research has underscored the degree to which end-of-life care in the United States needs to be improved.  The challenges of end-of-life care are particularly significant in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care system because he VA provides care for an increasingly older population with multiple comorbid conditions.  In FY2000, approximately 104,000 enrolled Veterans died in the U.S., and approximately 27,200 Veterans died in VA facilities.  At least 30% of the Veterans are over age 65 now, and 46% will be over 65 by 2030.  Therefore, it is clear that the number of deaths in VA facilities will increase substantially as the World War II and Korean War Veterans age.  These demographic trends mean that, like other healthcare systems, the VA will face substantial challenges of providing care to Veterans near the end-of-life.  The VA has addressed this challenge aggressively in the last 5 year, however the VA has not yet developed and implemented measures of the quality of end-of-life care it provides to Veterans.  There are at least 3 reasons why adoption of a quality measurement tool is essential.  First, it would make it possible to define and compare the quality of end-of-life care at each VA facility and to identify opportunities for improvement.  Second, facilities and VISNs (geographic service divisions within the VA system) would be able to monitor the effectiveness of efforts to improve care locally and nationally, and would enable monitoring of the impact of the Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative, ensuring that expenditures are producing improvements in care.  Third, it will help the VA to recognize those facilities that provide outstanding end-of-life care, so that successful processes and structures of care can be identified and disseminated throughout the VA.  The BFS´s 17 close-ended items ask family members to rate aspects of the care that the Veteran received from the VA in the last month of life.  These items cover areas of care such as communication, emotional and spiritual support, pain management and personal care needs.  Two addditional items (not used in scoring) are open-ended and give family members the opportunity to provide comments regarding the care the patient received.  The BFS has undergone extensive development and has been pilot-tested for all inpatient deaths in Q4FY2008 in seven VISNs (1,2,4,5,8,11, and 22).  As of October 1, 2009, Q1FY2010, all inpatient deaths in all VISNs were included in the project.","The numerator is comprised of completed surveys (at least 12 of 17 structured items completed), where the global item question has an optimal response.  The global item question asks ""Overall, how would your rate the care that [Veteran] received in the last month of life"" and the possible answer choices are: Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair, or Poor.  The optimal response is Excellent.","The denominator consists of all inpatient deaths for which a survey was completed (at least 12 of 17 structured items completed), excluding: 1) deaths within 24 hours of admission (unless the Veteran had a previous hospitalization in the last month of life); 2) deaths that occur in the Emergency Department (unless the Veteran had a prior hospitalization of at least 24 hours in the last 31 days of life); 3) deaths that occur in the operating room; and 4) deaths due to suicide or accidents.

m0754,CARE - Consumer Assessments and Reports of End of Life,1632,"The CARE survey is mortality follow back survey that is administered to the bereaved family members of adult persons (age 18 and older) who died of a chronic progressive illness receiving services for at least 48 hours from a home health agency, nursing homes, hospice, or acute care hospital. The survey measures perceptions of the quality of care either in terms of unmet needs, family reports of concerns with the quality of care, and overall rating of the quality of care. The time frame is the last 2 days of life up to last week of life spent in a hospice, home health agency, hospital, or nursing home. 	The survey is based on structured literature review,(1) cognitive testing,(2) pre-test,(2) and national survey of the quality of end of life care.(3) The conceptual model is patient focused, family centered care(1) that posits that high quality care at the end of life is obtained when health care institutions: 1) provide the desired level of symptom palliation and emotional support; 2) treat the patient with respect; 3) promote shared decision making; 4) attend to the needs of caregivers for information and skills in providing care for the patient; 5) provide emotional support to the family before and after the patient’s death; and 6) coordinates care across settings of care and health care providers.  We are asking NQF approval for a single composite derived from the survey items that is presented as single score that varies from 0 to 100. This score indicates an institution quality of care end of life care in the last week of life. 	This is the “parent” survey of the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care Survey (4-7) that my colleagues and I have collaborated with the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization to create a self-administered survey that is used widely by hospices in the USA and other nations.  With the proposed development of accountable care organizations and other potential innovations in health care financing, we recognized the need for an instrument that would allow the comparisons across place of care when there is one entity coordinating and/or financing the care for population of decedents.  We have decided to submit the telephone based survey for NQF consideration based on the void of validated measures to capture consumer perceptions (i.e, bereaved family members) of the quality of care at the end of life across place of care.  This submission is not meant to be competitive with the existing NQF endorsed Family Evaluation of Hospice Care survey.     	This new proposed measure  for NQF consideration consists of the survey which has six domains and the new creation of 0-100 composite score that is composed of 14 of 17 core items.  1.

The measure reports a single summary RSRR, derived from the volume-weighted results of five different models, one for each of the following specialty cohorts based on groups of discharge condition categories or procedure categories: surgery/gynecology; general medicine; cardiorespiratory; cardiovascular; and neurology, each of which will be described in greater detail below. The measure also indicates the hospital-level standardized risk ratios (SRR) for each of these five specialty cohorts. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission (the admission included in the measure cohort). A specified set of planned readmissions do not count in the readmission outcome. CMS annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years or older, are enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, and hospitalized in non-federal hospitals.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, with the exception of certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an eligible index admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admission (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not counted as an outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.","The measure includes admissions for Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years and older and are discharged from all non-federal, acute care inpatient US hospitals (including territories) with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. Additional details are provided in S.9 Denominator Details.","The measure excludes index admissions for patients:1.

Readmission is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count in the readmission outcome. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years or older, are enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), and hospitalized in non-federal hospitals.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day all-cause readmission.

If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only the first one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, then no readmission is counted, regardless of whether a subsequent unplanned readmission takes place. This is because it is not clear whether such readmissions are appropriately attributed to the original index admission or the intervening planned readmission.Additional details are provided in S.5 Numerator Details.","This claims-based measure can be used in either of two patient cohorts: (1) patients aged 65 years or older or (2) patients aged 40 years or older. The cohort includes admissions for patients discharged from the hospital with either a principal discharge diagnosis of COPD \ OR a principal discharge diagnosis of respiratory failure with a secondary discharge diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD (see codes in the attached data dictionary) and with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. The measure is currently publicly reported by CMS for those patients 65 years and older who are Medicare FFS beneficiaries admitted to non-federal hospitals.

The top box score refers to the percentage of patients whose responses indicated excellent performance for a given measure. This approach is a kind of categorical scoring because the emphasis is on the score for a specific category of responses. The composite measures do not have a typical numerator. This section is used to describe the composite score. The composite score is the average proportion of respondents who answered the most positive response category across the questions in the composite. The top box numerators for items within Composite measures 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 is the number of respondents who answered “Yes, definitely” across the items in each composite. The top box composite score is the average proportion of respondents who answered “Yes, definitely” across the items in the composite.The top box numerator for items within Composite measure 3 is the number of respondents who answered “Yes” across the items in this composite. The top box composite score is the average proportion of respondents who answered “Yes” across the items in this composite.The top box numerator for the Measure 7, the Global Rating Item, is the number of respondents who answered 9 or 10 to the Global Rating Item.Note that for users who want to case-mix adjust their scores, case-mix adjustment can be done using the CAHPS macro and the adjustment is made prior to the calculation of the total score. For more, see section 2e.2.See also Attachment H: Reporting Measures for the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey.","The composite does not have a typical denominator statement.

The readmission rate, unadjusted for case-mix, is calculated as follows:number of index admissions with 1 or more readmissions within 30 days/total number of index admissions",Hospitalizations at general acute care hospitals for patients less than 18 years old.,"EXCLUSIONS FROM THE NUMERATOR (READMISSIONS) AND DENOMINATOR (INDEX HOSPITALIZATIONS)We exclude certain hospitalizations from the measure entirely (i.e., from the numerator and denominator) based on clinical criteria or for issues of data completeness or quality that could prevent assessment of eligibility for the measure cohort or compromise the accuracy of readmission rates. Hospitalizations are excluded from the measure if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. The hospitalization was at a specialty or non-acute care hospital.Rationale: The focus of the measure is admissions to hospitals that provide general pediatric acute care. Records for admissions to specialty and non-acute care hospitals are therefore omitted from the dataset. Because hospital type cannot be determined for records with missing data in the hospital type variable, these records are also removed from the dataset.2. Records for the hospitalization contain incomplete data for variables needed to assess eligibility for the measure or calculate readmission rates, including hospital type, patient identifier, admission date, discharge date, disposition status, date of birth, primary ICD-9 or principal ICD-10 diagnosis codes, or gender.Rationale: Complete and valid information for the variables listed above is needed to define the measure cohort and calculate case-mix-adjusted readmission rates. Identifying readmissions within 30 days requires information on dates of admission and end-of-service dates and the ability to link unique patient identifiers across inpatient claims records. Hospital identifiers are needed to determine the hospital at which index admissions occurred. The disposition status is needed to determine whether a patient was discharged or experienced some other outcome (e.g., was transferred to another acute care hospital, left against medical advice, died). Establishing a patient’s eligibility for membership in the pediatric cohort and performing case-mix adjustment requires an accurate date of birth and end-of-service date. Because gender is 1 of the variables used for case-mix adjustment, episodes of care with missing or inconsistent gender cannot be evaluated in the measure.3. Records for the hospitalization contain data of questionable quality for calculating readmission rates, includinga. Inconsistent date of birth across records for a patient.b. Discharge date prior to admission date.c. Admission or discharge date prior to date of birth.d. Admission date after a disposition status of death during a prior hospitalization.Rationale: Complete and valid information for the variables listed above is needed to define the measure cohort and calculate case-mix-adjusted readmission rates. Identifying readmissions within 30 days requires information on dates of admission and end-of-service. A valid disposition status is needed to determine whether a patient was discharged or experienced some other outcome (e.g., was transferred to another acute care hospital, left against medical advice, died). Establishing a patient’s eligibility for membership in the pediatric cohort and performing case-mix adjustment requires an accurate date of birth and end-of-service date.4. Codes other than ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes are used for the primary procedure.Rationale: ICD-9 or ICD-10 procedure codes are necessary for applying clinical exclusions.5. The patient was older than 18 years, 29 days at the time of admission.Rationale: This age exclusion limits the population to pediatric patients and prevents inclusion of records that overlap with adult readmission measures. Age eligibility for inclusion in the measure is based on age at the time of discharge from the index admission. Because the focus of the measure is pediatric patients, a patient’s hospitalization is ineligible for inclusion in the measure as an index admission if the patient was 18 years old or greater at the time of discharge. Because the subsequent observation period for readmissions is 30 days, a patient´s hospitalization is ineligible for inclusion in the measure as a readmission if the patient was older than 18 years, 29 days at the start of the readmission.6. The hospitalization was for obstetric care, including labor and delivery.Rationale: Hospitalizations for obstetric conditions are excluded because care related to pregnancy does not generally fall within the purview of pediatric providers.7. The primary ICD-9 or principal ICD-10 diagnosis code was for a mental health condition.Rationale: Hospitalizations for mental health conditions are excluded because patients admitted for psychiatric treatment are typically cared for in separate psychiatric centers that are not comparable to short-term acute care hospitals. We describe this analysis in detail in Section 2b.3 of the Measure Testing Submission Form.8. The hospitalization was for birth of a healthy newborn.Rationale: Hospitalizations for birth of healthy newborns are excluded because these hospitalizations, unlike all others, are not for evaluation and management of disease.EXCLUSIONS FROM THE DENOMINATOR ONLY (INDEX HOSPITALIZATIONS ONLY)We also apply further exclusions to the denominator only (i.e., these hospitalizations are excluded from index hospitalizations but could still meet criteria for readmissions). Hospitalizations are excluded from the denominator only if they meet any of the following criteria:9. The patient was 18 years old or older at the time of discharge.Rationale: Age eligibility for inclusion in the measure is based on age at the time of discharge from the index admission. Because the measure covers pediatric patients, a patient´s hospitalization is ineligible for inclusion in the measure as an index admission if the patient was 18 years old or greater at the time of discharge.10. The discharge disposition was death.Rationale: A patient must be discharged alive from an index admission in order to be readmitted. Therefore, any record with a discharge disposition of death cannot serve as an index admission.11. The discharge disposition was leaving the hospital against medical advice.Rationale: A discharge disposition of leaving against medical advice indicates that a patient left care before the hospital determined that the patient was ready to leave. 12. The hospital has less than 80% of records with complete patient identifier, admission date, and discharge date or less than 80% of records with complete primary ICD-9 or principal ICD-10 diagnosis codes. (Records for these hospitals are still assessed as possible readmissions, but readmission rates are not calculated for these hospitals due to their lack of complete data.)Rationale: Readmission rates are not calculated for hospitals missing large amounts of data for the above variables because these hospitals have limited data to accurately apply measure cohort exclusions and calculate case-mix-adjusted readmission rates. Assessing eligibility for the measure cohort and performing case-mix adjustment requires information on admission dates, end-of-service dates, and diagnosis codes. Identifying readmissions requires information on admission dates and end-of-service dates and the ability to link unique patient identifiers across inpatient claims records. 13. The hospital is in a state not being analyzed.Rationale: A claims database used for readmission analysis may contain records for hospitals located in states that are not included in the database (because covered patients may sometimes be admitted to out-of-state hospitals). Records for these out-of-state hospital admissions are not excluded from the measure dataset because these records may meet criteria for being counted as readmissions as part of an in-state hospital’s readmission rate. However, readmission rates are not calculated for out-of-state hospitals due to the lack of complete data for these hospitals.14.

The measure assesses individuals on a 0-100 scale. There are 4 levels of activation, from low (1) to high (4). The measure is not disease specific, but has been successfully used with a wide variety of chronic conditions, as well as with people with no conditions. The performance score would be the change in score from the baseline measurement to follow-up measurement, or the change in activation score over time for the eligible patients associated with the accountable unit.The outcome of interest is the patient’s ability to self-manage.  High quality care should result in gains in ability to self-manage for most chronic disease patients. The outcome measured is a change in activation over time. The change score would indicate a change in the patient´s knowledge, skills, and confidence for self-management.  A positive change would mean the patient is gaining in their ability to manage their health. A “passing” score for eligible patients would be to show an average net 3-point PAM score increase in a 6-12 month period.  An “excellent” score for eligible patients would be to show an average net 6-point PAM score increase in a 6-12 month period.","The numerator is the summary score change for the aggregate of eligible patients in that unit (e.g., patients in a primary care provider´s panel, or in a clinic).  The change score would be calculated from a baseline score and then a second score taken within 12 months of the baseline score (but not less than 6 months).  The change score is the difference between the baseline and the second score in a 12-month period.  The aggregate score would be the total score for the eligible patient population.  The total aggregate score could be a positive or a negative number. A “passing” score for eligible patients would be to show an average net 3-point PAM score increase in a 6-12 month period.  An “excellent” score would be for eligible patients to show an average of a 6-point PAM score increase in a 6-12 month period.","All patients can be included in the denominator, except patients under the age of 19 and adults with a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairments (based on ICD codes).  Also excluded would be patients who do not have two PAM scores.  Finally, we exclude all patients who are at level 4 at baseline (as they are unlikely to gain in activation over time).

m0865,All-Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs),2502,"This measure estimates the risk-standardized rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions for patients (Medicare fee-for-service [FFS] beneficiaries) discharged from an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) who were readmitted to a short-stay acute-care hospital or a Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH), within 30 days of an IRF discharge. The measure is based on data for 24 months of IRF discharges to non-hospital post-acute levels of care or to the community.A risk-adjusted readmission rate for each facility is calculated as follows:Step 1: Calculate the standardized risk ratio of the predicted number of readmissions at the facility divided by the expected number of readmissions for the same patients if treated at the average facility. The magnitude of the risk-standardized ratio is the indicator of a facility’s effects on readmission rates. Step 2: The standardized risk ratio is then multiplied by the mean rate of readmission in the population (i.e., all Medicare FFS patients included in the measure) to generate the facility-level standardized readmission rate. For this measure, readmissions that are usually for planned procedures are excluded. Please refer to Appendix Tables A1-A5 for a list of planned procedures.The measure specifications are designed to harmonize with CMS’ hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure to a great extent. The HWR (NQF #1789) estimates the hospital-level, risk-standardized rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions within 30 days of a hospital discharge, similar to this IRF readmission measure.","The numerator is mathematically related to the number of patients in the target population who have the event of an unplanned readmission in the 30- day post-discharge window. The measure does not have a simple form for the numerator and denominator—that is, the risk adjustment method used does not make the observed number of readmissions the numerator and a predicted number the denominator. Instead, the numerator is the risk-adjusted estimate of the number of unplanned readmissions that occurred within 30 days from discharge. This estimate includes risk adjustment for patient characteristics and a statistical estimate of the facility effect beyond patient mix.","The denominator is computed with the same model used for the numerator. It is the model developed using all non-excluded IRF stays in the national data. For a particular facility the model is applied to the patient population, but the facility effect term is 0. In effect, it is the number of readmissions that would be expected for that patient population at the average IRF. The measure includes all the IRF stays in the measurement period that are observed in national Medicare FFS data and do not fall into an excluded category.","The measure excludes some IRF patient stays; some of these exclusions result from data limitations. The following are the measure’s denominator exclusions, including the rationale for exclusion: 1.	IRF patients who died during the IRF stay. Rationale: A post-discharge readmission measure is not relevant for patients who died during their IRF stay.2.	IRF patients less than 18 years old. Rationale: IRF patients under 18 years old are not included in the target population for this measure. Pediatric patients are relatively few and may have different patterns of care from adults. 3.	IRF patients who were transferred at the end of a stay to another IRF or short-term acute care hospital. Rationale: Patients who were transferred to another IRF or short-term acute-care hospital are excluded from this measure because the transfer suggests that either their IRF treatment has not been completed or that their condition worsened, requiring a transfer back to the acute care setting. The intent of the measure is to follow patients deemed well enough to be discharged to a less intensive care setting (i.e., discharged to less intense levels of care or to the community).4.	Patients who were not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months prior to the IRF stay admission date, and at least 30 days after IRF stay discharge date. Rationale: The adjustment for certain comorbid conditions in the measure requires information on acute inpatient bills for 1 year prior to the IRF admission, and readmissions must be observable in the observation window following discharge. Patients without Part A coverage or who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans will not have complete inpatient claims in the system. 5.	Patients who did not have a short-term acute-care stay within 30 days prior to an IRF stay admission date. Rationale: This measure requires information from the prior short-term acute-care stay in the elements used for risk adjustment. 6.	IRF patients discharged against medical advice (AMA).  Rationale: Patients discharged AMA are excluded because these patients have not completed their full course of treatment in the opinion of the facility. 7.	IRF patients for whom the prior short-term acute-care stay was for nonsurgical treatment of cancer. Rationale: Consistent with the HWR Measure, patients for whom the prior short-term acute-care stay was for nonsurgical treatment of cancer are excluded because these patients were identified as following a very different trajectory after discharge, with a particularly high mortality rate. 8.	IRF stays with data that are problematic (e.g., anomalous records for hospital stays that overlap wholly or in part or are otherwise erroneous or contradictory).Rationale: This measure requires accurate information from the IRF stay and prior short-term acute-care stays in the elements used for risk adjustment.

m0871,Skilled Nursing Facility 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure (SNFRM),2510,"This measure estimates the risk-standardized rate of all-cause, unplanned, hospital readmissions for patients who have been admitted to a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) (Medicare fee-for-service [FFS] beneficiaries) within 30 days of discharge from their prior proximal hospitalization. The prior proximal hospitalization is defined as an admission to an IPPS, CAH, or a psychiatric hospital. The measure is based on data for 12 months of SNF admissions. A risk-adjusted readmission rate for each facility is calculated as follows:Step 1: Calculate the standardized risk ratio of the predicted number of readmissions at the facility divided by the expected number of readmissions for the same patients if treated at the average facility. The magnitude of the risk-standardized ratio is the indicator of a facility’s effects on readmission rates. Step 2: The standardized risk ratio is then multiplied by the mean rate of readmission in the population (i.e., all Medicare FFS patients included in the measure) to generate the facility-level standardized readmission rate. For this measure, readmissions that are usually for planned procedures are excluded.  Please refer to the Appendix, Tables 1 - 5 for a list of planned procedures.The measure specifications are designed to harmonize with CMS’ hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure to the greatest extent possible. The HWR (NQF #1789) estimates the hospital-level, risk-standardize rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions within 30 days of a hospital discharge and uses the same 30-day risk window as the SNFRM.","This measure is designed to capture the outcome of unplanned all-cause hospital readmissions (IPPS or CAH) of SNF patients occurring within 30 days of discharge from the patient’s prior proximal acute hospitalization. The numerator is more specifically defined as the risk-adjusted estimate of the number of unplanned readmissions that occurred within 30 days from discharge from the prior proximal acute hospitalization. The numerator is mathematically related to the number of SNF stays where there was hospitalization readmission, but the measure does not have a simple form for the numerator and denominator—that is, the risk adjustment method used does not make the observed number of readmissions the numerator and a predicted number the denominator. The numerator, as defined, includes risk adjustment for patient characteristics and a statistical estimate of the facility effect beyond patient mix. Hospital readmissions that occur after discharge from the SNF stay but within 30 days of the proximal hospitalization are also included in the numerator.  Readmissions identified using the Planned Readmission algorithm (see Section S.6) are excluded from the numerator. This measure does not include observation stays as a readmission (see Section S.6).","The denominator is computed with the same model used for the numerator. It is the model developed using all non-excluded SNF stays in the national data. For a particular facility the model is applied to the patient population, but the facility effect term is 0. In effect, it is the number of SNF admissions within 1 day of a prior proximal hospital discharge during a target year, taking denominator exclusions into account. Prior proximal hospitalizations are defined as admissions to an IPPS acute-care hospital, CAH, or psychiatric hospital.","The following are excluded from the denominator: 1.	SNF stays where the patient had one or more intervening post-acute care (PAC) admissions (inpatient rehabilitation facility [IRF] or long-term care hospital [LTCH]) which occurred either between the prior proximal hospital discharge and SNF admission or after the SNF discharge, within the 30-day risk window. Also excluded are SNF admissions where the patient had multiple SNF admissions after the prior proximal hospitalization, within the 30-day risk window. Rationale: For patients who have IRF or LTCH admissions prior to their first SNF admission, these patients are starting their SNF admission later in the 30-day risk window and receiving other additional types of services as compared to patients admitted directly to the SNF from the prior proximal hospitalization.  They are clinically different and their risk for readmission is different than the rest of SNF admissions. Additionally, when patients have multiple PAC admissions, evaluating quality of care coordination is confounded and even controversial in terms of attributing responsibility for a readmission among multiple PAC providers. Similarly, assigning responsibility for a readmission for patients who have multiple SNF admissions subsequent to their prior proximal hospitalization is also controversial. 2.	SNF stays with a gap of greater than 1 day between discharge from the prior proximal hospitalization and the SNF admission.Rationale: These patients are starting their SNF admissions later in the 30-day risk window than patients admitted directly to the SNF from the prior proximal hospitalization. They are clinically different and their risk for readmission is different than the rest of SNF admissions. 3.	SNF stays where the patient did not have at least 12 months of FFS Medicare enrollment prior to the proximal hospital discharge (measured as enrollment during the month of proximal hospital discharge and the for 11 months prior to that discharge).Rationale: FFS Medicare claims are used to identify comorbidities during the 12-month period prior to the proximal hospital discharge for risk adjustment. Multiple studies have shown that using lookback scans of a year or more of claims data provide superior predictive power for outcomes including rehospitalization as compared to using data from a single hospitalization (e.g., Klabunde et al., 2000; Preen et al, 2006; Zhang et al., 1999).4.	SNF stays in which the patient did not have FFS Medicare enrollment for the entire risk period (measured as enrollment during the month of proximal hospital discharge and the month following the month of discharge).Rationale: Readmissions occurring within the 30-day risk window when the patient does not have FFS Medicare coverage cannot be detected using claims.  5.	SNF stays in which the principal diagnosis for the prior proximal hospitalization was for the medical treatment of cancer. Patients with cancer whose principal diagnosis from the prior proximal hospitalization was for other diagnoses or for surgical treatment of their cancer remain in the measure.Rationale: These admissions have a very different mortality and readmission risk than the rest of the Medicare population, and outcomes for these admissions do not correlate well with outcomes for other admissions. 6.	SNF stays where the patient was discharged from the SNF against medical advice. Rationale: The SNF was not able to complete care as needed.7.	SNF stays in which the principal primary diagnosis for the prior proximal hospitalization was for “rehabilitation care; fitting of prostheses and for the adjustment of devices”. Rationale: Hospital admissions for these conditions are not for acute care.",Yes,Outcome,measure,,,"Care Coordination: Readmissions, Safety, Safety: Overuse",Post-Acute Care,Patient Safety: Readmissions,"Public Reporting, Quality Improvement (external benchmarking to organizations), Quality Improvement (Internal to the specific organization)","Claims, Other",Facility,Elderly,,,"Dec 09, 2016",Endorsed,12/23/2014 12:00:00 AM,Annual Update,,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,MMSSupport@Battelle.org,,Not Applicable,Not applicable,

m0873,All-Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs),2512,"This measure estimates the risk-standardized rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions for patients (Medicare fee-for-service [FFS] beneficiaries) discharged from a Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH) who were readmitted to a short-stay acute-care hospital or a Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH), within 30 days of an LTCH discharge. The measure is based on data for 24 months of LTCH discharges to non-hospital post-acute levels of care or to the community.A risk-adjusted readmission rate for each facility is calculated as follows:Step 1: Calculate the standardized risk ratio of the predicted number of readmissions at the facility divided by the expected number of readmissions for the same patients if treated at the average facility. The magnitude of the risk-standardized ratio is the indicator of a facility’s effects on readmission rates. Step 2: The standardized risk ratio is then multiplied by the mean rate of readmission in the population (i.e., all Medicare FFS patients included in the measure) to generate the facility-level standardized readmission rate. For this measure, readmissions that are usually for planned procedures are excluded. Please refer to Appendix Tables A1-A5 for a list of planned procedures.The measure specifications are designed to harmonize with CMS’ hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure to a great extent. The HWR (NQF #1789) estimates the hospital-level, risk-standardized rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions within 30 days of a hospital discharge, similar to this LTCH readmission measure.","The numerator is mathematically related to the number of patients in the target population who have the event of an unplanned readmission in the 30- day post-discharge window. The measure does not have a simple form for the numerator and denominator—that is, the risk adjustment method used does not make the observed number of readmissions the numerator and a predicted number the denominator. Instead, the numerator is the risk-adjusted estimate of the number of unplanned readmissions that occurred within 30 days from discharge. This estimate includes risk adjustment for patient characteristics and a statistical estimate of the facility effect beyond patient mix.","The denominator is computed with the same model used for the numerator. It is the model developed using all non-excluded LTCH stays in the national data. For a particular facility the model is applied to the patient population, but the facility effect term is 0. In effect, it is the number of readmissions that would be expected for that patient population at the average LTCH. The measure includes all the LTCH stays in the measurement period that are observed in national Medicare FFS data and do not fall into an excluded category.","The measure excludes some LTCH patient stays; some of these exclusions result from data limitations. The following are the measure’s denominator exclusions, including the rationale for exclusion: 1.LTCH patients who died during the LTCH stay. Rationale: A post-discharge readmission measure is not relevant for patients who died during their LTCH stay.2.LTCH patients less than 18 years old. Rationale: LTCH patients under 18 years old are not included in the target population for this measure. Pediatric patients are relatively few and may have different patterns of care from adults. 3.LTCH patients who were transferred at the end of a stay to another LTCH or short-term acute-care hospital. Rationale: Patients who were transferred to another LTCH or short-term acute-care hospital are excluded from this measure because the transfer suggests that either their LTCH treatment has not been completed or that their condition worsened, requiring a transfer back to the acute care setting. The intent of the measure is to follow patients deemed well enough to be discharged to a less intensive care setting (i.e., discharged to less intense levels of care or to the community).4.Patients who were not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months prior to the LTCH stay admission date, and at least 30 days after LTCH stay discharge date. Rationale: The adjustment for certain comorbid conditions in the measure requires information on acute inpatient bills for 1 year prior to the LTCH admission, and readmissions must be observable in the observation window following discharge. Patients without Part A coverage or who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans will not have complete inpatient claims in the system.5.Patients who did not have a short-term acute-care stay within 30 days prior to an LTCH stay admission date. Rationale: This measure requires information from the prior short-term acute-care stay in the elements used for risk adjustment. 6.LTCH patients discharged against medical advice (AMA).  Rationale: Patients discharged AMA are excluded because these patients have not completed their full course of treatment in the opinion of the facility. 7.LTCH patients for whom the prior short-term acute-care stay was for nonsurgical treatment of cancer. Rationale: Consistent with the HWR Measure, patients for whom the prior short-term acute-care stay was for nonsurgical treatment of cancer are excluded because these patients were identified as following a very different trajectory after discharge, with a particularly high mortality rate. 8.LTCH stays with data that are problematic (e.g., anomalous records for hospital stays that overlap wholly or in part or are otherwise erroneous or contradictory).Rationale: This measure requires accurate information from the LTCH stay and prior short-term acute-care stays in the elements used for risk adjustment.

Both scenarios are hereafter referred to as ""hospital stays.""","The outcome for this measure is 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission following a qualifying index hospital stay (see S.7-S.11 for more details). We define a readmission as a subsequent hospital inpatient admission within 30 days of either the discharge date (for inpatients) or claim end date (for outpatients – hereafter referred to as ""discharge date"") following a qualifying hospital stay. We do not count as readmissions any subsequent outpatient procedures or any subsequent admissions which are identified as ""staged"" or planned. If a patient has more than one unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge from the index hospital stay, only the first one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each index hospital stay has an unplanned readmission within 30 days.  (See S.6, Numerator Details, for more information.)",The target population for this measure includes inpatient and outpatient hospital stays for patients at least 65 years of age who receive one or more qualifying vascular procedure.,"Hospital stays are excluded from the cohort if they met any of the following criteria:1) Lack of follow-up in Medicare FFS for at least 30 days post-discharge. Hospital stays for patients without at least 30 days of enrollment in Medicare FFS after discharge from the index stay are excluded. Rationale: We exclude these hospital stays because the 30-day readmission outcome cannot be assessed in this group.2) Hospital stays for patients who leave hospital against medical advice (AMA). Hospital stays for patients who are discharged AMA are excluded.Rationale: We exclude hospital stays for patients who are discharged AMA because providers in these circumstances do not have the opportunity to deliver full care and prepare the patient for discharge.3) Hospital stays with a qualifying vascular procedure that occur within 30 days of a previous hospital stay with a qualifying vascular procedure. Subsequent hospital stays with a qualifying vascular procedure within 30 days of discharge from an index hospital stay will not be counted as another index hospital stay.Rationale: Qualifying vascular procedures occurring within 30 days of discharge from an index hospital stay fall within the 30-day readmission assessment period during which no new hospital stay can be counted as an index hospital stay.

The measure was developed using Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) patients 65 years and older and was tested in all-payer patients 18 years and older. An index admission is the hospitalization for a qualifying isolated CABG procedure considered for the readmission outcome.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day all-cause readmission.

m0883,Facility 7-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy,2539,"Rate of risk-standardized, all-cause, unplanned hospital visits within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients aged 65 years and older.","The outcome for this measure is all-cause, unplanned hospital visits within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy. We define a hospital visit as any emergency department (ED) visit, observation stay, or unplanned inpatient admission.",Colonoscopies performed at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) for Medicare FFS patients aged 65 years and older.,"We established the following exclusion criteria after reviewing the literature, examining existing measures, discussing alternatives with the working group and technical expert panel (TEP) members, and reviewing feedback from the national dry run held in July 2015. The goal was to be as inclusive as possible; we excluded only those high-risk procedures and patient groups for which risk adjustment would not be adequate or for which hospital visits were not typically a quality signal. The exclusions, based on clinical rationales, prevent unfair distortion of performance results.1) Colonoscopies for patients who lack continuous enrollment in Medicare FFS Parts A and B in the 7 days after the procedure.Rationale: We exclude these patients to ensure full data availability for outcome assessment.2) Colonoscopies that occur concurrently with high-risk upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures. Rationale: Patients undergoing concurrent high-risk upper GI endoscopy procedures, such as upper GI endoscopy procedures for the control of bleeding or treatment of esophageal varices, are often unwell and have a higher risk profile than typical colonoscopy patients. Therefore, these patients have a disproportionally higher risk for the outcome.3) Colonoscopies for patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diagnosis of IBD at time of index colonoscopy. Rationale: We exclude these patients because:	-IBD is a chronic condition; patients with IBD undergo colonoscopy both for surveillance due to increased cancer risk and for evaluation of acute symptoms. IBD is likely to be coded as the primary diagnosis prompting the procedure irrespective of whether the patients are undergoing a screening procedure or a diagnostic procedure in the setting of an acute exacerbation of IBD. Therefore, we may not be able to adequately risk adjust for these patients as we cannot identify relatively well versus acutely unwell patients among visits coded as IBD. 	-Our aim is to capture hospital visits which reflect the quality of care. Admissions for acutely ill IBD patients who are evaluated with an outpatient colonoscopy and are subsequently admitted for medical treatment of an IBD flare do not reflect the quality of the colonoscopy. In our 2010 Medicare 20% FFS Full Development Sample (see the Facility 7-day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy Measure Technical Report posted on the web page provided in data field S.1 for full description of the dataset), more than one-third of IBD patients admitted to the hospital with colonoscopy had a discharge diagnosis of IBD, indicating their admission was for medical treatment of their IBD. We therefore excluded this group so that providers who treat a disproportionate number of IBD patients will not be disadvantaged in the measure.4) Colonoscopies for patients with a history of diverticulitis or diagnosis of diverticulitis at time of index colonoscopy. Rationale: We exclude these patients because:	-It is unclear what the health status is of patients coded with a history or current diagnosis of diverticulitis, making it difficult to fully risk adjust for patients’ health. Colonoscopies performed on patients with a history or current diagnosis of diverticulitis are likely to be coded as diverticulitis as the primary diagnosis irrespective of whether the patients are undergoing a screening procedure or a diagnostic procedure (i.e., are acutely unwell with active disease). Furthermore, the codes for diverticulitis and diverticulosis may not be consistently used; patients with diverticulosis may be erroneously coded as diverticulitis. Therefore, we may not be able to adequately risk adjust as we cannot identify relatively well versus acutely unwell patients among visits coded as diverticulitis. 	-Admissions for acutely ill patients with a history or current diagnosis of diverticulitis who are evaluated with an outpatient colonoscopy and are subsequently admitted for medical treatment of do not reflect the quality of the colonoscopy. In our 2010 Medicare 20% FFS Full Development Sample (see the Facility 7-day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy Measure Technical Report posted on the web page provided in data field S.1) more than one-quarter of patients with a history or current diagnosis of diverticulitis admitted to the hospital post colonoscopy had a discharge diagnosis of diverticulitis, indicating they were admitted for medical treatment of the condition. These admissions are likely unrelated to the quality of the colonoscopy. We therefore excluded this group so that providers who treat a disproportionate number of diverticulitis patients will not be disadvantaged in the measure.5) Colonoscopies that occur on the same hospital outpatient claim as an ED visit.Rationale: We exclude these patients because:	-The sequence of events in these cases is not clear. It is not possible to use claims data to determine whether the colonoscopy was the cause of, subsequent to, or during the ED visit.6) Colonoscopies that occur on the same hospital outpatient claim as an observation stay.Rationale: We exclude these patients because:	-The sequence of events in these cases is not clear. It is not possible to use claims data to determine whether the colonoscopy was the cause of, subsequent to, or during the observation stay.7) Colonoscopies followed by a subsequent outpatient colonoscopy procedure within 7 days.Rationale: We exclude these patients because:	-The two colonoscopies are considered part of a single episode of care, for which the subsequent colonoscopy is considered the index procedure.",Yes,Outcome,measure,"Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting, Hospital Compare, Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting",Gastrointestinal (GI),"Safety, Safety: Complications, Screening","Inpatient/Hospital, Outpatient Services",Patient Safety: Readmissions,,"Claims, Other",Facility,"Elderly, Populations at Risk",,,"May 12, 2016",Endorsed,12/23/2014 12:00:00 AM,Endorsement Maintenance,,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,Helen.Dollar-Maples@cms.hhs.gov,,Not applicable,Not applicable,

Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the procedure date of an index CABG admission. The measure was developed using Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) patients 65 years and older and was tested in all-payer patients 18 years and older.

We have tested the measure in both age groups.The cohort includes admissions for patients who receive a qualifying isolated CABG procedure (see codes below) and with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission.

Hospitalizations for:1) Patients with inconsistent or unknown vital status or other unreliable data.Rationale: We exclude these because the outcome cannot be adequately measured in these patients.2) Patients who leave the hospital against medical advice (AMA)Rationale: We exclude hospitalizations for patients who are discharged AMA because providers did not have the opportunity to deliver full care and prepare the patient for discharge.3) Patients with qualifying CABG procedures subsequent to another qualifying CABG procedure during the measurement periodRationale: CABG procedures are expected to last for several years without the need for revision or repeat revascularization.

m0913,CAHPS® Hospice Survey (experience with care),2651,"The measures submitted here are derived from the CAHPS® Hospice Survey, which is a 47-item standardized questionnaire and data collection methodology.  The survey is intended to measure the experiences of hospice patients and their primary caregivers.The measures proposed here include the following six multi-item measures.•	Hospice Team Communication•	Getting Timely Care•	Treating Family Member with Respect•	Getting Emotional and Religious Support•	Getting Help for Symptoms•	Getting Hospice TrainingIn addition, there are two other measures, also called “global ratings.”•	Rating of the hospice care•	Willingness to recommend the hospiceBelow we list each multi-item measure and its constituent items, along with the two ratings questions.  Then we briefly provide some general background information about CAHPS surveys.List of CAHPS Hospice Survey MeasuresMulti-Item MeasuresHospice Team Communication (Composed of 6 items)+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team keep you informed about when they would arrive to care for your family member?+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team explain things in a way that was easy to understand?+	How often did the hospice team listen carefully to you when you talked with them about problems with your family member’s hospice care?+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team keep you informed about your family member’s condition?+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team listen carefully to you?+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did anyone from the hospice team give you confusing or contradictory information about your family member’s condition or care?Getting Timely Care (Composed of 2 items)+	While your family member was in hospice care, when you or your family member asked for help from the hospice team, how often did you get help as soon as you needed it?+	How often did you get the help you needed from the hospice team during evenings, weekends, or holidays? Treating Family Member with Respect (Composed of 2 items)+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team treat your family member with dignity and respect?+	While your family member was in hospice care, how often did you feel that the hospice team really cared about your family member?Providing Emotional Support (Composed of 3 items)+	While your family member was in hospice care, how much emotional support did you get from the hospice team? +	In the weeks after your family member died, how much emotional support did you get from the hospice team? +	Support for religious or spiritual beliefs includes talking, praying, quiet time, or other ways of meeting your religious or spiritual needs. While your family member was in hospice care, how much support for your religious and spiritual beliefs did you get from the hospice team?Getting Help for Symptoms (Composed of 4 items)+	Did your family member get as much help with pain as he or she needed?+	How often did your family member get the help he or she needed for trouble breathing? +	How often did your family member get the help he or she needed for trouble with constipation?+	How often did your family member receive the help he or she needed from the hospice team for feelings of anxiety or sadness?Getting Hospice Care Training (Composed of 5 items)+	Did the hospice team give you enough training about what side effects to watch for from pain medicine?  +	Did the hospice team give you the training you needed about if and when to give more pain medicine to your family member?+	Did the hospice team give you the training you needed about how to help your family member if he or she had trouble breathing?+	Did the hospice team give you the training you needed about what to do if your family member became restless or agitated? +	Side effects of pain medicine include things like sleepiness.  Did any member of the hospice team discuss side effects of pain medicine with your or your family member?Rating Measures:In addition to the multi-item measures, there are two “global” ratings measures.  These single-item measures indicate on the one hand the need for quality improvement and on the other hand provide families and patients looking for care with evaluations of the care provided by the hospice.  The items are rating of hospice care and willingness to recommend the hospice.+	Rating of Hospice Care:  Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst hospice care possible and 10 is the best hospice care possible, what number would you use to rate your family member’s hospice care?+	Willingness to Recommend Hospice:  Would you recommend this hospice to your friends and family?The CAHPS Hospice Survey is a standardized survey instrument designed to collect reports and ratings of experiences with hospice care.  The survey is completed by the primary caregiver of the patient who died while receiving hospice care (hereafter, “decedent”).  The primary caregiver is intended to be the family member or friend most knowledgeable about the decedent’s hospice care, and is identified through hospice administrative records. Data collection for sampled decedents/caregivers is initiated two months following the month of the decedent’s death.The CAHPS Hospice Survey is part of the CAHPS family of experience of care surveys and is available in the public domain at https://cahps.ahrq.gov/surveys-guidance/hospice/index.html. CMS initiated national implementation of the CAHPS Hospice Survey in 2015. Hospices meeting CMS eligibility criteria were required to administer the survey for a “dry run” for at least one month of sample from the first quarter of 2015. Beginning with the second quarter of 2015, hospices are required to participate on an ongoing monthly basis in order to receive their full Annual Payment Update from CMS. Information regarding survey content and national implementation requirements, including the latest versions of the survey instrument and standardized protocols for data collection and submission, are available at: http://www.hospicecahpssurvey.org/.A list of the CAHPS Hospice Survey measures, including the components of the multi-item measures can be found in Appendix A.",CMS calculates CAHPS Hospice Survey measures using top-box scoring. The top-box score refers to the percentage of caregiver respondents that give the most positive response.  Details regarding the definition of most positive response are noted in Section S.6 below.,"The measure’s denominator is the number of survey respondents who answered the item. The target population for the survey is primary caregivers of hospice decedents. The survey uses screener questions to identify respondents eligible to respond to subsequent items.  Therefore, denominators will vary by survey item (and corresponding multi-item measures, if applicable) according to the eligibility of respondents for each item.","The exclusions noted in here are those who are ineligible to participate in the survey.  The one exception is caregivers who report on the survey that they “never” oversaw or took part in the decedent’s care; these respondents are instructed to complete the “About You” and “About Your Family Member” sections of the survey only. Cases are excluded from the survey target population if:•	The hospice patient is still alive •	The decedent’s age at death was less than 18 •	The decedent died within 48 hours of his/her last admission to hospice care•	The decedent had no caregiver of record•	The decedent had a caregiver of record, but the caregiver does not have a U.S. or U.S. Territory home address •	The decedent had no caregiver other than a nonfamilial legal guardian•	The decedent or caregiver requested that they not be contacted (i.e., by signing a no publicity request while under the care of hospice or otherwise directly requesting not to be contacted)•	The caregiver is institutionalized, has mental/physical incapacity, has a language barrier, or is deceased•	The caregiver reports on the survey that he or she “never” oversaw or took part in decedent’s hospice care",Yes,Outcome: PRO-PM,measure,Hospice Quality Reporting,Palliative Care and End-of-Life Care,"Access to Care, Person-and Family-Centered Care",Home Care,Person- and Family-Centered Care,"Public Reporting, Quality Improvement (external benchmarking to organizations)",Instrument-Based Data,Facility,,,,"Oct 26, 2016",Endorsed,10/26/2016 12:00:00 AM,Annual Update,,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,debra.dean-whittaker@cms.hhs.gov,,,"This questionnaire is not copyrighted.

As a result, performance should not be assessed with the expectation of a “perfect” outcome of 100% amoxicillin usage.  Nonetheless, results over 90% should be readily achieved in most care contexts.  The prevalence of penicillin allergy has been previously reported at =5% (Borch, JE et al.

m0943,Pediatric Computed Tomography (CT) Radiation Dose,2820,"The measure requires hospitals and output facilities that conduct Computed Tomography (CT) examinations in children to: 1. Review their CT radiation dose metrics, 2. calculate the distribution of the results, and 3.compare their results to benchmarks. This would then imply a fourth step to investigate instances where results exceed a trigger value for underlying cause, such as issues with protocol, tech, equipment, patient, etc. It is important to review doses of radiation used for CT, as the doses are far higher than conventional radiographs (x-rays), the doses are in the same range known to be carcinogenic (Pearce, Lancet, 2012; Ozasa, Radiation Research, 2012), and the higher the doses, the greater the risk of subsequent cancer (Miglioretti, JAMA Pediatrics, 2013) Thus the goal of the measure is to provide a framework where facilities can easily assess their doses, compare them to benchmarks, and take corrective action to lower their doses if they exceed threshold values, as per specifications in benchmarks.The measure calls for assessment of doses for the most frequently conducted CT examination types, and compare these doses to published benchmarks. The measure calls for the assessment of radiation doses within four anatomic areas (CT’s of the head, chest, abdomen/pelvis and combined chest/abdomen/pelvis.) The measure provides a simple framework for how facilities can assess their dose, compare their doses to published benchmarks (Smith-Bindman, Radiology, 2015) and identify opportunities to improve if their doses are higher than the benchmarks. For example, If a hospital finds their doses are higher than published benchmarks, they can review the processes and procedures they use for performance of CT in children and take corrective action, and follow published guidelines for how to lower doses (such as “child sizing” the doses, reducing multiple phase scans, and reducing scan lengths). Published benchmarks for radiation dose in children exist (Smith-Bindman, Radiology, 2015) and additional benchmarks are under development and will be published within the year by us. (Kumar, 2015)  Other groups have also published benchmarks (Goeske) or in the process of doing so.Our work and that of others have shown that institutional review of dose metrics as outlined in this measure results in a significant lowering of average and outlier doses. (Demb, 2015; Greenwood, RadioGraphics, 2015; Miglioretti, JAMA Pediatrics, 2013; Keegan, JACR, 2104; Wilson, ARRS, 2015).   This measure is being proposed for diagnostic CT in children, but can also be used for CT in adults, and CT used in conjunction with radiation therapy for cancer. Whenever context the doses are used, the doses should be compared with appropriate benchmarks.A similar measure (#0739) was previously endorsed by the NQF in 2011. The NQF did not provide ongoing endorsement when the measure was up for renewal in 2015, primarily because there was no evidence that assessing doses as called for in the measure would result in an improvement in outcomes (i.e. patient dose). Since that time, there has been additional research that has shown that assessing doses using the format outlined in the measure does indeed result in lower doses, and thus we are re-submitting a similar although updated measure.Of note, the surrogate measure we are using for outcomes is radiation dose. The true outcome of interest is the number of cancers that result from imaging. Because of the lag time between exposure to radiation and cancer development (years to decades) it is not feasible to use cancer cases as the outcome of a quality improvement effort. Thus while there is ample evidence that radiation causes cancer (sited below), and evidenced that cancer risk is proportional to dose, there are no direct data that suggest that lowering doses lowers cancer risk. However, we have used mathematical modeling to try to understand the relationship between lowering doses and cancers and estimated that if the top quartile of doses were reduced in children (i.e. the very high doses are brought down the average doses), the number of cancer cases would be reduced by approximately 43%, the equivalent to preventing 4,350 cancer cases / year in the US among children (Miglioretti, JAMA Pediatrics 2013).Cited in this section:Demb J, manuscript under preparation.

The metrics are 1) mean dose as measured using DLP, CTDIvol, and SSDE: within age strata. And 2) the proportion of exams with doses greater than the 75th percentile of the benchmark you are comparing with for the same anatomic area strata (Kumar, 2015; Smith-Bindman, Radiology, 2015; Goske, Radiology, 2013)The CTDIvol and DLP are directly reported by the scanner using an “industry wide” standardized dose report (DICOM Radiation Dose Structured Report). The data should be assembled for the entire CT examination. If there are several series, the CTDIvol values should be averaged, and the DLP values should be added.SSDE can be calculated using any dose monitoring software product, or using published multiplier coefficients which are highly valid. These different metrics are highly correlated, but nonetheless reveal important differences regarding radiology practice and performance and are thus complimentary. However, if a practice only assesses data from a single metric, there is substantial opportunity for data-driven improvement.CTDIvol reflects the average dose per small scan length. Modern CT scanners directly generate this.DLP reflects the CTDIvol x scan length, and is directly generated by modern CT scanners.SSDE is a modified measure of CTDIvol that takes into account the size of the patient scanned and is useful for scaling dose to patient size. Several current radiation tracking software tools directly report SSDE.Cited in this sectionGoske MJ, Strauss KJ, Coombs LP, et al. Diagnostic reference ranges for pediatric abdominal CT.

m0944,PointRight® Pro Long Stay(TM) Hospitalization Measure,2827,"The PointRight Pro Long Stay Hospitalization Measure is an MDS-based, risk-adjusted measure of the rate of hospitalization of long-stay patients (aka “residents”) of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) averaged across the year, weighted by the number of stays in each quarter.","The numerator for the measure is the sum over four quarters of the counts of hospitalizations of the quarterly denominator populations, where hospitalizations comprise discharges directly from the SNF to an acute care hospital. The count of hospitalizations excludes discharges from the SNF to LTACHs, IRFs, and psychiatric hospitals, and excludes admissions to acute care hospitals that directly follow a discharge from the SNF to a setting other than an acute care hospital.  However, if a patient is discharged from a SNF directly to an acute care hospital during a quarter at risk, the hospitalization will be counted in the numerator even if the patient was discharged to a setting other than an acute care hospital earlier in that quarter. Hospitalizations are counted over at-risk intervals of 3 months at a time because this period is long enough to yield nonzero numerators even for SNFs with low rates of hospitalization, yet short enough so that almost all of the denominator population will be present in the facility for all, or almost all, of the period. The latter feature makes the calculation simpler than if the risk exposure was calculated by days or weeks.Four quarters of denominators and four quarters of numerators are summed to yield the values for the full measure period.","The quarterly denominator population consists exactly of those patients present in the SNF on the first day of the quarter (the “snapshot date”) who meet the criterion for long stay on that date. The denominator for a quarter is the number of patients in the quarterly denominator population. The denominator for the measure is the sum of the quarterly denominators for the four quarters in the 12 month measure period. The criterion for a patient’s having a long stay is a cumulative length of stay in the facility of more than 100 days as of the snapshot date. The cumulative length of stay of a patient is the length of the current stay as of the snapshot date and plus the full lengths of stay of any previous stays that are linked to it. According to the criteria for linkage of stays used in the present measure, a stay in a SNF is linked to a subsequent stay in the SNF if the patient was discharged from the SNF to the community and was readmitted to the SNF within 10 days or fewer. All stays in a sequence of linked stays are included in the sum of days used to determine a patient’s cumulative length of stay. In these criteria the term “community” comprises private residences and all organized settings that are primarily residential in character, including senior housing, independent living facilities, board and care homes, and assisted living facilities.A patient can contribute multiple times to the denominator for a 12 month measure period.  For example, a resident continuously present in the facility for a full year would contribute four to the denominator.","There are no exclusions from the denominator; all patients in the facility on the snapshot date who meet the long stay criterion on that date are included.

Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the index admission date for stroke patients. This measure is a newly developed measure with a cohort and outcome that is harmonized with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS’s) current publicly reported claims-based stroke mortality measure, and includes the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale as an assessment of stroke severity in the risk-adjustment model. The measure is referred to as a hybrid because it is CMS’s intention to calculate the measure using two data sources: Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) administrative claims and clinical electronic health record (EHR) data.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day, all-cause mortality. We define mortality as death from any cause within 30 days of the index admission for patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.Additional details are provided in S.5 Numerator Details.","The cohort includes inpatient admissions for Medicare FFS patients, age 65 years and older, who were discharged from non-federal, short-term, acute care hospitals with a principal discharge diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.Additional details are provided in S.7 Denominator Details.","The measure excludes admissions for patients: 1.

Similarly, for the three-year combined data, when index admissions occur during the transition between measure reporting periods (June and July of each year) and both are randomly selected for inclusion in the measure, the measure includes only the June admission.

The measure reports a single summary RSRR, derived from the volume-weighted results of five different models, one for each of the following specialty cohorts based on groups of discharge condition categories or procedure categories: surgery/gynecology, general medicine, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology. The measure also indicates the hospital-level standardized readmission ratios (SRR) for each of these five specialty cohorts. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission (the admission included in the measure cohort). A specified set of readmissions are planned and do not count in the readmission outcome. The target population is Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries who are 65 years or older, and hospitalized in non-federal hospitals.This Hybrid HWR measure is a re-engineered version of the HWR measure 1789, the Hospital-Wide All-Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure, which was developed for patients 65 years and older using Medicare claims and is currently publicly reported in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program. This reengineered measure uses clinical data elements from patients’ electronic health records in addition to claims data for risk adjustment.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, with the exception of certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an eligible index admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admission (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not counted as an outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.","The measure includes admissions for Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years and older and are discharged from all non-federal, acute care inpatient US hospitals (including territories) with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission.Additional details are provided in S.7 Denominator Details.","The Hybrid HWR measure excludes index admissions for patients:1.

m0985,CAHPS® Home- and Community-Based Services Measures,2967,"CAHPS Home- and Community-Based Services measures derive from a cross disability survey to elicit feedback from adult Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home and community based services (HCBS) about the quality of the long-term services and supports they receive in the community and delivered to them under the auspices of a state Medicaid HCBS program.  The unit of analysis is the Medicaid HCBS program, and the accountable entity is the operating entity responsible for managing and overseeing a specific HCBS program within a given state.  (For additional information on the accountable entity, see Measures Testing form item #1.5 below.)The measures consist of seven scale measures, 6 global rating and recommendation measures, and 6 individual measures:Scale Measures 1.

Hit or hurt by staff –average proportion of respondents that gave the most positive response of “No” on a 1-2 scale (Yes, No)","The denominator for all measures is the number of survey respondents. Individuals eligible for the CAHPS Home- and Community-Based Services  survey include Medicaid beneficiaries who are at least 18 years of age in the sample period, and have received HCBS services for 3 months or longer and their proxies.  Eligibility is further determined using three cognitive screening items, administered during the interview:Q1. Does someone come into your home to help you? (Yes, No)Q2. How do they help you?Q3. What do you call them?Individuals who are unable to answer these cognitive screening items are excluded. Some measures also have topic-specific screening items as well. Additional detail is provided in S.9.According to guidance produced under the CMS TEFT Technical Assistance contract, individuals who are more likely to be good proxy respondents during the CAHPS Home- and Community-Based Services survey data collection are: (a) those who are willing to respond on behalf of the beneficiary; (b) unpaid caregivers, family members, friends, and neighbors; and (c) those who know the beneficiary well enough that s/he is familiar with the services/supports they are receiving, and has regular, ongoing contact with them. Examples of circumstances that increase the likelihood that someone has knowledge about the beneficiary and their care situation include living with the beneficiary, managing the beneficiary’s in-home care for a majority of the day, having regular conversations with the beneficiary about the services they receive, in-person visits with the beneficiary, and being present when services/supports are delivered.  Individuals who are less likely to be good proxy respondents are (a) those with paid responsibilities for providing services/supports to the beneficiary, including family members and friends who are paid to help the beneficiary and (b) guardians or conservators whose only responsibility is to oversee the beneficiary’s finances.","Individuals less than 18 years of age and individuals that have not received HCBS services for at least 3 months should be excluded. During survey administration, additional exclusions include individuals that failed any of the cognitive screening items mentioned in the denominator statement below. There were 227 beneficiaries excluded due to not passing the cognitive screener (53 Aged/Disabled, 59 ID/DD, 25 TBI, and 90 SMI).

m1024,Continuity of Primary Care for Children with Medical Complexity,3153,This measure assesses the percentage of children with medical complexity age 1 to 17 years old who have a Bice-Boxerman continuity of care index (hereafter referred to as Bice-Boxerman COC index) of >=0.5 in the primary care setting over a 12-month period.,"Number of eligible children(1) who have a Bice-Boxerman COC index >=0.50 in the primary care setting during the measurement year.1. Eligible children are defined as children who are continuously enrolled for 12 months with no more than a 30-day gap in enrollment. Children with a gap greater than 30 days are excluded because of the potential for them to be enrolled in a different health plan at that time. In such cases, the child’s administrative data for the health plan being measured would be incomplete and thus might not reflect the health plan’s true performance on the measure. The timeframe of 30 days as the length of the gap was chosen to be consistent with the month-to-month eligibility assessments used by many Medicaid health plans.","Children with medical complexity(1) who are 1-17 years old(2) and who have had >= 4 primary care visits(3) during the measurement year. 1. Children with medical complexity are defined as children who are classified by the Pediatric Medical Complexity algorithm, Version 2 (PMCA-V2) as having no chronic illness or non-complex chronic illness.2.

m1025,Informed Participation,3154,"Improved measurement of the continuity of insurance coverage in the Medicaid and CHIP population is needed to help maximize insurance continuity and coverage for vulnerable children. To further this goal, the AHRQ-CMS CHIPRA PQMP Center of Excellence at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia developed the metric Informed Coverage. The metric is designed to more accurately measure coverage among children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP at the state level and overcome the current inability in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) dataset to determine whether a child disenrolled from Medicaid and CHIP due to loss of eligibility (such as due to parental income increase or the acquisition of employer-sponsored insurance, a “good” reason) or failure to appropriately re-enroll (a “bad” reason). This measure can help federal and state programs develop strategies to retain children eligible for coverage and minimize gaps that can occur during the renewal process. Informed Coverage assesses the continuity of enrollment of children in publicly financed insurance programs (Medicaid and CHIP), as defined by the ratio of enrolled month to eligible months over an 18 month observation window. Informed Coverage uses a natural experiment based on the random event of appendicitis to “inform” the estimate of coverage in a given state, bounded by two extreme assumptions regarding unknown eligibility information: Coverage Presumed Eligible (PE) and Coverage Presumed Ineligible (PI).",The numerator for Informed Coverage represents the sum (within a state) of months enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP for all children over an 18-month window.,"The sum (within a state) of months eligible for Medicaid/CHIP for all children (0-18 years) over an 18-month window. In addition, months that could be defined as “eligible” are based on known events recorded in the MAX data that would affect eligibility (birth or ageing out).","For the appendicitis calculation, the population is limited to children between the ages of 2 to 16 years old. To determine what is the best assumption to use (either the Appendectomy Coverage Rate (or ACR), PI, or PE) inside each state, we compare the observed appendectomy coverage rate in a state, to the estimated coverage rate that would be calculated in that state with either PI, or PE assumptions.",No,Outcome,measure,,,,No Applicable Care Setting,Affordable Care: Access,"Not in use, Public Reporting, Quality Improvement (external benchmarking to organizations), Quality Improvement (Internal to the specific organization)",Claims,Population: Regional and State,,,,"Jul 12, 2017",Endorsed,7/12/2017 12:00:00 AM,None,,The Children´s Hospital of Philadelphia,silber@email.chop.edu,http://cor.research.chop.edu/node/26,,,
